## A potted history of economic history (especially in the United States)

.pull-left60[
+ People have been writing 'economic history' for a long-time
  - This is a story of disciplinary growth and identity
+ Economics had a strong historical component at beginning of 20th c.
  - E.g. Harvard awards first US chair in Economic History in 1892 to William Ashley
  - But growing tensions around theory vs history
+ Growing divide between historians vs economists with increased interest in quantification in 1930s
  - E.g. Elizabeth Gilboy who we saw earlier in the course
]

.pull-right40[
> The economist is likely to suggest topics and problems that strike the historian as anachronistic and ahistorical, since available evidence will not be able to support such an inquiry. On the other hand, the questions raised by the historian – representing an attempt at mediation between what one would like to know and what the sources disclose – may seem to the economist to be devoid of any economic significance. <br> Cipolla, *Between Two Cultures*, p. 16

.pull-left[
## Professionalization

+ Research is still very interdisciplinary
+ In 1940 group of economists & historians form Economic History Association (EHA)
+ Around same time create Research Center in Entrepreneurial History
  - Again, a mix of economists, historians and sociologists

  > "The starting point for [RCEH's] thinking was Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of entrepreneurship as a creative act that in discontinuous fashion shifted outward the economy’s production possibility frontier (Schumpeter 1934). Entrepreneurship was important to study, they believed, because this kind of creativity was the key to greater economic well-being." <br> -Lamoreaux, "Beyond", p. 7
]
  
### The Cliometric Revolution

+ Mostly economists: Gerschenkron, Kuznets, Fogel, North
  - Use models, statistical testing, and computers to work with data to a greater extent
+ Critical of existing work

> “Even a cursory examination of accepted ‘truths’ of U.S. economic history suggests that many of them are inconsistent with elementary economic analysis and have never been subjected to — and would not survive — testing with statistical data” <br> —North

.pull-left[

> "The fuss about counterfactual history was itself, however, largely **a proxy war for a more fundamental disagreement about the importance of entrepreneurial innovation to economic growth.** Fogel promoted the neoclassical view that **technological change was induced by movements in relative prices** that signaled opportunities for profit. In the absence of the railroad, he argued, not only was it likely that the canal system would have expanded to meet the demand for low-cost transportation services in the U.S., but the automobile could well have been developed earlier: “The axiom of indispensability proceeds on the implicit and unverified assumption that the success of railroads did not choke off the search for other solutions to the problem of overland transportation” (Fogel 1964: 14-15)." <br> —Lamoreaux, "Beyond", p. 13.

> "Increasingly after the 1890’s in the editorial columns of trade journals and in the pages of government reports, for one industry after another, blame for the British lag behind Germany and America was put on British management." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg

## The 'Entrepreneurial Failure' view

> "It was the heirs of Veblen and Schumpeter, ...who in the 1950’s carried on the development of the hypothesis of entrepreneurial failure. An important factor in this work was a group of economic historians ... who developed the argument in the late 1940’s and 1950’s that **the linchpin of economic history is the entrepreneur**. ...Building on [a] piece presented [at] ... the Harvard University Center in Entrepreneurial History ...Landes crystallized the long-standing argument that the contrast between German and American industrial triumphs and British defeats could best be explained by emphasis on “the importance of this human factor — the success of entrepreneurial and technological creativity on one side, the failure on the other.“" <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 92

#### Menu of indictments run:

1. Britain did not adopt best technologies
2. Britain underestimated imp. of science and industrial applied research
3. Britain over-invested in export staples like cotton/iron
4. Britain was bad at sales, especially abroad
5. Britain did not organize cartels effectively

### McCloskey & Sandberg's Critique

.pull-left[

#### Core of critique:

> "...But in a competitive milieu, even a brief period of irrationality would be eroded by the expansion of better managed firms, and there is little doubt that the British economy was on the whole competitive." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg p. 104

+ 'Irrational' behavior is assumed incompatible with market competition: no money on the table

> "...the orthodox neoclassical, or 'cliometric' approach, which in emphasizing the rationality of entrepreneurs denies the very notion of failure." <br> —Kirby, p. 637.
]

.pull-left[
#### Some general pertinent critiques

+ Argument by residual

> "Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth." <br> –Sherlock Holmes

<br>

> "Entrepreneurship has always been studied as a residual, because it is not a variable that can be measured directly." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 107


]

## McCloskey & Sandberg Critique, cont'd

#### Critique measure of entrepreneurial failure

> "...an industry’s output or an industry’s speed in adopting allegedly critical innovations ... Neither of these measures is adequate ... the measures of output because they confound influences of demand with those of supply and the measures of indicative innovations because they neglect the variability in the advantage to be gained from different innovations in different countries."<br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 100

#### Discuss a gamut of industry case studies

> "One swallow, then, does not make a summer, nor do scattered cases of entrepreneurial successor failure make or break the hypothesis of general entrepreneurial failure." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg p. 99

+ But think on balance case studies rejecting claims of irrationality

## Elbaum & Lazonick Institutionalist Response

.center[
![:scale 80%](figures/elbaum_lazonick_decline.png)
]

> "...the historical perspective presented below attributes the decline of the British economy to the rigid persistence of economic and social institutions from the nineteenth-century era of relatively atomistic competition. ...successful twentieth-century economic development has been based on mass production methods and corporate forms of managerial coordination. But in Britain adoption of these modern technological and organizational innovations was impeded by inherited socioeconomic constraints" <br> —Elbaum & Lazonick, p. 568

---

## Elbaum & Lazonick Institutionalist Response, Cont'd

.pull-left[
### Critique

> "...the issue of Britain's decline has largely been avoided by neoclassical economic historians who have been preoccupied with demonstrating that turn-of-the-century British managers "did the best they could" by optimizing subject to given constraints" (568)

+ Even if entrepreneurs were not irrational, this does not address the issue of decline!!
]

.pull-right[
### Argument

> "The managerial organization and technology employed by nineteenth- century British firms were comparatively simple. Characteristically, firms were run by owner-proprietors or close family associates." (569)

+ Argument is **Chandlerian**: need large-scale corporate structure

> "What British industry in general required was **the visible hand of coordinated control**, not the invisible hand of the self-regulating market."

.left-column[
## Elbaum & Lazonick's Claim

+ Is 20th century economic growth a story of states/firms subordinating markets?
]

.right-column.large[
> "There is considerable irony in the neoclassical focus on free market competition as the engine of economic dynamism. The focus derives from the fundamental assumption of neoclassical theory that firms are subordinate to markets. History suggests, however, that successful development in the twentieth century has been achieved by markets being made subordinate to firms. **The main thrust of the perspective presented here is that the British economy failed to make a successful transition to corporate capitalism in the twentieth century precisely because of the very highly developed market organization of the economy that had evolved when it was the first and foremost industrial nation.**" (582)]

---

## Elbaum & Lazonick: Critical Appraisal

#### Endorsed by Kirby as a productive agenda

> "The institutional focus, moreover, is entirely credible in the light of the intellectual stalemate which has developed in British economic history between the upholders of entrepreneurial failure and neoclassical rationality. Elbaum and Lazonick may be **accused of naivete in their assumption of the universal validity of corporate capitalism as the route to successful economic growth** in the twentieth century, but much of value remains in their analysis. There can be little doubt that in the British context the state has had a legitimate role to play in securing institutional reforms beneficial to economic progress. Only the most extreme proponent of the free market could contend, for example, that the complex structural problems of the late nineteenth-century British economy, the starting point for Elbaum and Lazonick's analysis, could have been resolved by market forces unaided" (654)

#### Some critique

+ Scholars such as Leslie Hannah suggest idea that 'small family firms' were characteristic of Europe is generally untrue
  - London and Paris stock exchanges larger and more important than New York
  - Bigger hubs for the separation of ownership and control

### Case: The Lancashire Cotton Industry vs the New England Cotton Industry (Leunig 2003)

#### Why Lancashire?

+ Use the older technology (mule for spinning and power loom) 
  - Could be 'entrepreneurial failure' to adopt best tech?
+ Very small businesses with almost no vertical integration
  - Could be failure to adopt modern management and scale economies

> "It was the industry that grew by adding more and more firms, with little or no growth in firm size." (90)

#### Why might US be more productive?

+ Rothbarth-Habakkuk thesis

> "At its simplest, this states that in land-rich America, labour was drawn to agriculture, so that industry became characterized by high capital intensity and by correspondingly high labour productivity. In contrast, land-poor Britain had abundant industrial labour, so industry was characterized by low capital intensity and low labour productivity." (92)

---

## Not so simple to compare

> "In theory, labour productivity is easy to calculate: total output is simply divided by total employment. In reality, the process is not as straightforward because countries often produce different products, with different labour and capital requirements." (97)

+ Cotton output often measured by **weight**
  - This is bad because finer thread means more length per unit weight
+ Course thread vs fine thread are basically different products
  - E.g. used for bags vs clothes
+ Different technologies (mule vs ring) can take different quality inputs
  - Rings need higher quality (more expensive) input or fibers break
  - Mules possibly more labor but cheaper input

.pull-left[
### Leunig's approach

+ $2 \times 2 \times product$ design
+ For each thread count
]

.pull-right[

+ Compare NE to Lanc
  - For rings
  - For mules
]

## Results: labor productivity by technology and location

.pull-left40[
+ Lanc. spinners on mules best
+ NE on rings close for low thread count

<br>

.pull-right60.center[

## Results: but which location was more productive?

.pull-left40[
+ The question is given the available machines and people, where should you send a job to produce 100 lbs of 40 thread count yarn

<br>

+ **Still mostly Lancashire**
+ NE is possibly better at very low thread count output
]
.pull-right60.center[
![:scale 95%](figures/leunig_fig_3.png)]

---

## Interpretation

> .Large["I argue ...the most plausible proximate cause of Lancashire's success was external economies of scale, and that this reflects a deeper underlying advantage: vigorous competition." (108)]

+ Some vindication for McCloskey & Sandberg!
+ External economies of scale:
  - Economies of scale that are not internal to the company (obvious definition)
  - E.g. having all the skilled weavers available in Lancashire
  - Learning right away about new techniques
+ Argues that Lancashire may have been "more Chandlerian"
  - Because focused on fewer products, firms had more spindles, produced longer runs
  - More like mass production
  - Half a loaf for Elbaum & Lazonick?

---

## Some provocative reflections from Leunig

> "The idea that competition increases the pressure to be efficient may help to explain why Britain was so much more succesful in the first industrial revolution than in the second. Both of Britain's early productivity successes — textiles and agriculture — were characterized by low minimum efficient scale and high levels of competitive pressure." (110)

+ Contrast that with quintessential second IR technology: the car
  - US is big and can support multiple car firms that compete *and* have massive scale
  
> "...the size of the British domestic market was too small for Britain to have a car firm that was simultaneously large enough to gain available economies of scale, and to face sustained competitive pressure from at least one other firm." (110)

+ Concludes that you need competitive pressure **and** a market big enough to support competition at efficient scale
