## The standard of living debate

> "What happened to the standard of living of the working class during the British industrialization has probably been the most contentious issue in economic history" (Horrell & Humphries, p. 849).

<br>

> "Very few questions in economic history have been the focus of such prominent and persistent attention as the controversy about the impact of early industrialization and capitalism on the standard of living of the British working class" (Feinstein, p. 625).

## The old view on the standard of living

>  And did the Countenance Divine,<br>
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br>
And was Jerusalem builded here,<br>
Among these dark Satanic Mills?<br> -William Blake

<br>

> "A feeling very generally exists that the condition and disposition of the Working Classes is a rather ominous matter at present; that something ought to be said, something ought to be done, in regard to it." <br> -Thomas Carlyle, *Chartism*, pp. 1

<br> 

+ Early writers on the IR (Hammond and Hammond, *Town labourer*; Webb and Webb, *Industrial democracy*; Toynbee, *Lectures*) stressed the poverty, inequality and negative externalities of industrialization

+ LW (*EHR* 1983) computed wages and found an 80% rise in real wages between 1780 and 1850
    - To compute a real wage:
        - Measure wages in all sectors in a year $w_{1,1840}, w_{2, 1840}, ...$ (e.g. agriculture)
        - Measure how big each sector is in a year $s_{1, 1840}, s_{2, 1840}, ...$ (e.g. 30%)
        - Measure how much things cost in a year $p_{1840}$
        - Add it all up and divide by prices
    - Measurement depends on measuring wages, shares and prices!

 \texttt{realwage}_{1840} = [s_{1, 1840} \times w_{1,1840} + \\

> "The present account of trends in living standards also seems **more plausible in relation to other indicators** of well-being. It accords better with the evidence of a sharp deterioration in infant and child mortality. It eliminates the paradox of the decline in nutritional status indicated by the early nineteenth-century height data occurring at a time of an allegedly swift advance in living standards." <br> -Feinstein, p. 652

## Height as a measure of human welfare?

#### Anthropometrics

+ A *net* measure
+ Lots of historical sources
+ Requires only height and age

#### But...

+ Several problems
  - Bias/truncation
  - Composition effects
  - Separating out the cause of height change
      * Epidemics? Public health works? Child labor
  - When *exactly* do we grow?

On **average** height is not genetic

>  "Newcomers to the idea that stature measures important aspects of the standard of living should not be sidetracked by genetic issues. **Genes are important determinants of individual height, but genetic differences approximately cancel in comparisons of averages across most populations**, and in these situations heights accurately reflect health status." <br> —Steckel, "Stature", p. 1903

<br>

> "We do question whether parts of the literature add to our understanding of long-term changes in economic well-being because they rely on choice- based samples... Several militaries ... relied on volunteers rather than conscripts drawn randomly from their underlying populations.

### A sentimental conclusion
