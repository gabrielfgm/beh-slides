name: return

## Preliminaries 

I want you to...

+ Do the reading
+ Talk! 
    - Active learning is much more effective
+ Engage with numerical evidence
    - [We all start somewhere](#message)

You should take from this...

+ An overview of British economic development, but also...
+ Highly transferable analytic skills!

## Historical national accounts

+ Historical national income accounting -- attempts to measure GDP `r AutoCite(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2015"])`
    * Is GDP a good measure of anything? 
    * Alternatives (HDI)?
    * What is the 'average' person?

## How the sausage gets made: GDP

Three ways to measure GDP

1. Income:

$GDP =(\texttt{daily wage-rates} \times \texttt{days worked}) + \\ (\texttt{return on capital} \times \texttt{capital stock}) + \\ (\texttt{rent} \times \texttt{land area})$
 
2. Expenditure:

$GDP = \texttt{consumption} + \texttt{investment} + \texttt{government spending} + \\ \texttt{net exports}$

3. Output:

$GDP = \texttt{agricultural value added} + \texttt{industrial value added} + \\  \texttt{services value added}$

`r Citet(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2015"])` attempt the *output* approach.

---

## How the sausage gets made: GDP

+ How hard is output based estimation?
+ To compute output just for agriculture:
    1. estimate amount of land under different ag. uses
    2. derive trends in cropped areas
    3. and trends in crop yields
    4. derive livestock numbers 
    5. and livestock yields
    6. aggregate these numbers from farms weighted by spatial area
    7. convert total outputs to value added using prices and knowledge of cost structure
    8. convert to real prices
+ Incredibly difficult and incredibly imprecise undertaking!

## How the sausage gets made: GDP 

+ Why do it this way?
    - Existing wage series `r AutoCite(bib["clarkConditionWorkingClass2005", "clark1381MalthusDelusion2013"])` [did not seem to match other historical evidence!](#clarkvbroadberry) `r AutoCite(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2012"])`
    - Macro/micro ways of approaching the problem are in dialogue

--

## Is sausage healthy?

+ Do we want national accounts? Are they helpful?
    - GDP during the actual period of the industrial revolution does not seem to move
    - National accounts can give the illusion of stasis
+ By 1820 only 35% of Brits work in agriculture whereas 60-80% on the continent do:
    - A big shift in *what* people are doing

---

### Overcoming 'Organic'/Malthusian constraints

+ Ricardo describes diminishing *marginal* returns from land `r AutoCite(bib["wrigleyPovertyProgressPopulation2004"])`
    - What does *marginal* mean?
+ And yet population grows!
+ `r Citet(bib["clarkConditionWorkingClass2005"])` shows that the negative association of income and wages becomes a positive association after ~1650

---

## What accounts for the jump in growth? Productivity

+ *Productivity*: doing more with what you have
+ This does not resolve the problem, merely pushes it back (where does productivity come from?)
+ If you know:
    - Change in prices of a good
    - Change in price index
    - Change in price of inputs
+ You can compute change in productivity `r AutoCite(bib["mccloskey17801860Survey1994"])`
    * actually need to additionally assume markups don't change a lot

---

## Productivity: the evidence from prices

>"The diminution of price has . . . been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the materials are the coarse metals. A better movement of a watch, that about the middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds, may now perhaps be had for twenty shillings." 
<br>
> —Adam Smith (1976 , bk. 1, ch. 11, pt. 3) `r AutoCite(bib["kellyAdamSmithWatch2016"])`

---

---

## Productivity: the example from watches

+ Average real price in 1710: £6
+ Average real price in 1809: £2
+ Average fall in price: approx. -1.3% per year
    - Wages were roughly unchanged
    - adjusting for quality changes productivity gains of roughly 2% a year.

---

## Division of labor

+ In a mid-eighteenth-century description of London trades, Campbell (1747 , p. 250) described how watches “at their first appearance . . . were began and ended by one man who was called a watchmaker” but “of late years the watchmaker . . . scarce makes anything belonging to a watch. He only deploys the different tradesmen among who the art is divided.” `r AutoCite(bib["kellyAdamSmithWatch2016"])`

+ “...if the Demand of Watches shou’d become so very great as to find constant imployment for as many Persons . . . the Maker of the Pins, or Wheels, or Screws, or other Parts, must needs be more perfect and expeditious at his proper work, . . . than if he is also to be imploy’d in all the variety of a Watch.” `r AutoCite(bib["henryConsiderationsEastIndiaTrade1701"])`

## A growth-accounting framework

+ Agricultural output is the result of combining
    - Land
    - Labor
    - Capital
+ Productivity is how *well* you combine them
+ Measuring inputs is a good starting point since productivity is poorly understood

# Part 2: Agricultural revolution

---

## What do we mean when we say revolution?

At least 4 interpretations `r AutoCite(bib["overtonAgriculturalRevolutionEngland1996"])`:

--
1. A transformation in agricultural technique

--
2. Agriculture's ability to feed the growing population

--
3. Productivity increases

--
4. Broader criteria of change (an 'Agrarian Revolution') associated with institutional reform

---

### When was the Agricultural Revolution? Some conflicting interpretations

### Traditional View

+ Late-18th early 19th century

--

### Revisionist views

+ 17th century

--

### More revision

+ Even further into the past (16th century-17th century)
+ Unusual views: mid-19th century!

## Agricultural technological innovation

.Large[
+ Crop rotation
+ Husbandry
+ Land improvement
+ Technology
]

---

## Crop rotation

.pull-left40[

+ Core innovations revolved around crop-use
+ Targeted use of crops to improve nitrogen fixation in soil and boost yields
+ Decreases the time that fields need to lie fallow
]

.pull-right60[
```{r, overfig, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/overton_twoviews.png")
```
]
---

## Husbandry

> "But, without any improper partiality to our own country, we are fully justified in asserting, that Britain alone exceeds all modern nations in husbandry." <br> -*Encyclopaedia Britannica*, 1797, i 249 cited (and endorsed) in `r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"])`

<br>

> "Nowhere is the culture of enrichment through improvement based on experience and experiment better illustrated than in the area of livestock breeding" <br> -`r AutoCite(bib["mokyrEnlightenedEconomyEconomic2012"])`.

<br>

- E.g. Bakewell's New Leicester Sheep: 15 years experimenting for a sheep that is 1.) fleshy, 2.) gains weight early in life, 3.) high muscle to bone ratio. Although "wool was of middling quality" `r AutoCite(bib["mokyrEnlightenedEconomyEconomic2012"])`.
- E.g. due to breeding cost of horses for transport falls 20-30% between 1724 and 1816-21 `r AutoCite(bib["gerholdProductivityChangeRoad1996"])`.

---

## Land improvement

+ Draining

> "The only modern technique that raised yields was hollow draining, and its diffusion was indeed responsible for the growth of yields in the heavy arable district" <br> -`r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"])`.

<br>

> "...a revolution on the claylands brought about by tile under-draining which allowed the conventional 'agricultural revolution' to spread from light soils to heavier ones" <br> -`r AutoCite(bib["overtonAgriculturalRevolutionEngland1996", "sturgessAgriculturalRevolutionEnglish1966"])`

]
---

## The 'Great Men' of the agricultural revolution

+ The 'Great Men': Jethro Tull, Lord Townshend, Arthur Young, etc.

> "These men are seen to have triumphed over a conservative mass of country bumpkins and single-handedly transformed English agriculture within a few years from a peasant subsistence economy into a thriving capitalist agricultural system capable of feeding the teaming millions in the new industrial cities" <br> -`r AutoCite(bib["overtonAgriculturalRevolutionEngland1996"], after = ", p. 4")`.

---

## The 'Great Men' critiqued

+ Revision in the timing of improvment
+ Doubts about the *diffusion* of their innovations:

> "All in all, it seems implausible that all this intellectual activity affected more than a small sliver of the agricultural sector, and that its effects on overall output, with some exceptions, were modest and late" <br> -`r AutoCite(bib["mokyrEnlightenedEconomyEconomic2012"], after = ", p. 186")`.

+ Doubts about the *quality* of their innovations
    - e.g. Jethro Tull argued that air was the best fertilizer

.pull-right60[
```{r, allen_frontis, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/allen_enclosure_frontis.jpg")
```
]

---

## Enclosure: the traditional view

Allen's depiction of what he calls 'Agrarian Fundamentalism':

1. Technical revolution in farming caused by 'modernization' of rural institutions
2. Growth in agricultural productivity boosted early industrialization. 

> "The manufacturing cities were built with savings from the agricultural surplus, they were people with labour freed from farming, and they were fed with the food produced by improved methods." <br> —`r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"], after = ", p. 2")`

3. Increase in inequality an inherent feature. 

> "The idea that there is a trade-off between growth and equity is one of the most entrenched ideas of Agrarian Fundamentalism." <br> —`r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"], after = ", p. 2")`

---

## Enclosure: the traditional view

Early views quotes from `r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"], after = ", p. 3")`:

> "the destruction of the common-field system of cultivation; the enclosure, on a large scale, of commons and waste lands; and the consolidation of small farms into large...wrought, without doubt, distinct improvement from an agricultural point of view. They meant the substitution of scientific for unscientific culture." <br> —Toynbee (1884)

<br> 

> "Small yeomen, openfield farmers, and commoners could never have fed a manufacturing population. They could not have initiated and would not have adopted agricultural improvements." <br> —Ernle (1912)

---

## Enclosure: the traditional view

This view remains influential (quotes from `r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"])`):

+ "Enclosure of open fields, engrossing of smaller plots and holdings into larger agricultural units (units of production and tenure rather than units of ownership) established the basis of improvement...The break-up of the peasantry was the price England paid for the increased supplies of corn and meat to feed her growing population" (Mathias, *First Industrial*, 1983)
+ "The full benefits of drainage and root crops were not possible without enclosure...The land must be freed from communal restrictions that held back the numbers of livestock and technical improvements. The purpose of enclosure was to do precisely this...Yields may have been nearly doubled" (Wilson, *England's Apprenticeship*, 1984)

---

## Agrarian Fundamentalism

Allen suggests two flavors of Agrarian Fundamentalism

#### 1. Tory view

+ Enclosure begets more capital intensive agriculture
    - Think employment should *increase* because of profitability but fall as a percentage of population

#### 2. Marxist view

+ Enclosure is labor-shedding: frees workers to go to manufacturing

.large[**Both view it as necessary component of industrialization!**]

#### Allen's view:

+ "We have surely now heard the last of the incompatibility of small properties and small farms with agricultural improvement. (Mill 1848: 154)."

---

## The view from development economics

.pull-left[
#### Contemporary studies of peasant production suggest:
    
1. Production usually exhibits constants returns to scale
2. Small farms are typically more intensively worked 
  + household labor (e.g. grandparents)
3. Some of the additional work actually functions as capital formation 
4. Output per acre tends to be higher on smaller farms because of greater intensity
5. *Purchased* capital goods and fertilizers tend to give large farms an advantage because they borrow at cheaper rates

## What Allen argues

> "I argue that there were two agricultural revolutions in English history — the
yeomen's and the much more famous landlords'" <br> —`r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"], after = ", p. 13")`.

#### Rise and fall of Yeoman

+ Black Death $\rightarrow$ unrest $\rightarrow$ enclosure $\rightarrow$ provision of property rights c.16th
+ "The real collapse of yeoman agriculture occurred in the eighteenth century" (pp. 14)
    - sold their holdings to large estates where owners, or estates refuse to renew leases

#### **Most growth in output comes from yeomen's revolution**
  - Enclosed estates *do* adopt new tech faster, but aggregate effect is small
  - Landlord's revolution is a transfer of value to landlord

---

## Yeoman's revolution

+ A product predominantly of crop varieties, and rotations adopted between 1600-1750

> "There was a biological revolution in English agriculture between the middle ages and the nineteenth century — corn yields approximately doubled. That revolution was not the result of large-scale, capital-intensive farming" <br> —`r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"])`.

---

.pull-left40[
## Landlord's revolution

#### Rents rose benefitting landowners
  
- prices rise (.red[-consumers])
- rents on farm capital fall (.red[-tenants])
- wages stagnant (.red[-tenants])

## Conclusion

Labor productivity in agriculture grew for three reasons:

1. More land under cultivation and **increasing** $\texttt{land}/\texttt{labor}$ ratio
2. Increase in capital per worker
3. Increase in growing efficiency: the techniques of the ag revolution

Enclosure

+ Was not hugely important in increasing output
    - although does seem in general to raise efficiency slightly
+ But brought change in social relations
    - The agricultural labor force became predominantly salaried male adults

---

## Conclusion

+ Hard to argue Britons ate much better in 1850 than 1700 `r AutoCite(bib["mokyrEnlightenedEconomyEconomic2012"], after = ", p. 195")`.
+ But also tripled population and did not starve
    - Also did so without serious famine as in Ireland
+ "...Britain may by 1815 have had the most productive and advanced farming sector in the world, but it was *still* in its best interest to abandon all that and specialize in what it was best at, which was manufacturing and services" `r AutoCite(bib["mokyrEnlightenedEconomyEconomic2012"], after = ", p. 197")`.

# Discussion

---

class: inverse, center, middle

## Questions about Allen, "Tracking"

> "The concept of agricultural revolution does not mean simply an increase in output-it also implies an increase in productivity." Do you agree with this?

--
<br>

> Is Allen pursuasive in his advocacy for an earlier agricultural revolution?

--

## Questions about Kelly and O Grada

> In light of Kelly and O Grada's article, are estimates of agricultural output precise enough to meaningfully interpret trends over time?

--
<br> 

> Kelly and O Grada reference modern estimates from developing countries to try to calibrate the income elasticity of demand. Other economic historians (e.g. `r AutoCite(bib["allenEnclosureYeomanAgricultural1992"])`) also do this. Is this a helpful approach? A meaningful approach?

### Questions to think about when reading a regression

#### Did the authors omit variables that could change the relationship and should be included?

+ Requires researcher to argue for what should be included/excluded
  - This cannot be determined in statistical terms
  - A *qualitative* question about how the world works

#### Is the model appropriate?

- Did they measure things that are relevant?
- Did they measure them well?
- Is the relationship plausibly linear?

#### Is the relationship of a meaningful magnitude?

+ A lot of focus on statistical significance which we can ignore
+ Two key questions:
  - How uncertain are we about the relationship between two variables?
  - Is the size of the relationship big enough to matter?

### Contemporary notice

> "The substantial tradesman, who was wont to pass his evening at the ale house for  fourpence  half-penny,  now  spends  three  shillings  at  the  tavern,  while his  wife  keeps  card-tables  at  home;  she  must  likewise  have  fine  clothes,  her chaise  or  pad,  with  country  lodgings,  and  go  three  times  a  week  to  public diversions...  The gayest  places  of  public  entertainment  are  filled  with  fashionable figures; which, upon inquiry, will be found to be journeymen tailors, serving men, and abigails [ladies’ maids], disguised like their betters" (Smollett 1793).

--

### Berg's conclusion

> "Consumer aspirations across class and gender stimulated the rapid and extensive proliferation of new commodities from the later seventeenth century onwards. The supply-side responses to these aspirations were in turn to generate wider and deeper demand for these goods, bought to satisfy desires for fashion, respectability, sociability, or for convenience and comfort. These new consumer goods were generated through technological change, but above all through product innovation" (Berg, 2007, 246).

## Measuring and explaining consumption

+ Laborers seemed really poor (see week 8!) **who** was actually consuming?
+ The prices of consumer goods were falling (remember Adam Smith and Watch Prices?)
    - Was it a change in **preferences** that drove consumption?
    - Or was it a change in **prices**?
    - (Clearly its going to be at least in part prices — object is to measure how much.)

### Key Questions

What do we think about the composition of this sample?

Is it problematic for inferring trends in who owned what?

Is it problematic for inferring when they owned it?

---

## Measuring and explaining consumption

### The approach

+ For each **good** that is stolen (e.g. coins, stockings, etc.)
    - Examine change over time in average occupational status of owner
    - **But!**:
        + Need to net out change owing to price changes
        + Change owing to people getting richer (real wages)
        + And changes in the kind of good itself (improvements in quality)
+ General framework: **multiple regression**
+ Their interpretation: 
    - The relationship between occupational status and price reflects goods getting cheaper
    - The relationship between occupational status and time reflects changing tastes

## Measuring and explaining consumption

> "Our findings underline the importance of fashion and tastes, which exerted an independent influence on the ownership of all the items that we examined, but make space too for price and income effects. The relative magnitude of fashion, price, and income varied according to the specific item considered, but none should be omitted in an account of the consumer revolution, which our evidence suggests involved a complex interplay between desires and differentiation, and aspiration and affordability." <br>—Horrell et. al.

**The Revolt of the Early Modernists**: as we saw in the Agricultural revolution lecture the 17th and 18th centuries were far from static.

**The Revisionist Macroeconomics of the British IR**: The newer GDP estimates revised growth rates downwards -- growth rises far more smoothly from the 18th to the 19th century.

#### Theoretical building blocks

**The Western European Marriage Pattern**: a critical element in de Vries' theory of a family that is adaptable to the market, but whose behavior is not wholly determined by market forces.

**The 'New' Household Economics**: de Vries will tackle the 'black box' of the family unit by approaching it with microeconomic theory.

## A model of the family

.pull-left[


+ Families can allocate their time ( $T$ ) towards
    - Leisure ( $T_l$ )
    - House work ( $T_c$ )
    - Wage work ( $T_w$ )
    - And that accounts for all of their time: $T = T_l + T_c + T_w$

<br>

+ Families do not directly consume products, they transform them to consume them using their labor, and they consume them in their leisure
    - **e.g.** Products ( $x_i$ ) might be groceries and what is eaten ( $z_i$ ) is the product of the food and the labor allocated to preparing it
        + Consider shopping and cooking ( $T_c$, $T_w$, $x_i$ ) to eat ( $T_l$, $z_i$ ) as opposed to ordering take-out ( $\downarrow T_c$, $\uparrow T_w$, $x_j$ )

]

+ Family welfare is the sum of what they consume ( $\sum_i z_i \pi_i$ )

> "Thompson saw the coming of industry as a watershed in the history of time and work. The pre-industrial world, he suggested, was marked by irregular work rhythms. Workers focused on completing certain tasks, rather than working for a set number of hours, and consequently there was little need for an understanding or application of clock time." <br> —Hailwoood, p. 2.

### The 'Fiscal-Military State'

> "In recent years it has been fashionable to downplay the importance of taxes in funding the bellicose expansion of the eighteenth-century English state and to emphasize the importance of a highly sophisticated system of public borrowing. This vogue is largely explained by the brilliant work of P.G.M. Dickson... But in ascribing the evolution of public indebtedness to the weakness of the English tax system, **Dickson underestimates the importance of taxes to the so-called financial revolution.** No matter how sophisticated the mechanism or means, the state’s ability to borrow was contingent upon the belief among its creditors that it had the capacity and determination to meet its payments." (Brewer, 1987, 73, my emph).

### Tax Power

## The Fiscal-Military State

+ Nexus of effective taxation and borrowing geared toward the pursuit of war
+ Growth in tax *not* mere reflection of economic growth
    - Between 1670 and 1810 tax receipts grow ~5 $\times$ faster than economy
    
> "The eclipse of the land tax was symptomatic of two developments which were of major importance to the subsequent history of the English state. The switch from direct to indirect taxation meant that the bulk of the revenue was no longer collected by a hodge-podge of amateur and local officials but by a centrally appointed body of crown employees. It also signalled the birth of the long-term national debt as more and more indirect taxes were assigned to fund government loans. In this way **the preponderance of indirect taxes was inextricably linked to the growth of public credit.**"

## The state, credibility, and restraint

.pull-left[

>"Other expedients to finance war which might have been tried (and were, by other powers), such as inflation of the currency or writing off accumulated debts, were by definition self-defeating in anything except the short run." (Dickson, pp. 10-11)

> "The land tax, despite its heavy incidence on the landed classes, was preferred by the House of Commons over other taxes because it was the most limited case of the exercise of executive power...

"Good" institutions may well be important for long-run growth, but the mechanism relating institutions and growth is apparently something other than an immediate reaction of financial markets and a reduction in the cost of capital. ...We believe that Britain's ascendancy to a position of supremacy in Europe and in the world was the outcome of very long processes... The evidence on the importance of the Glorious Revolution and the institutional changes of the seventeenth century as a turning point remains elusive." <br> (p. 929).

# Questions

>"...one necessary condition for the creation of modern economies dependent on specialization and division of labor (and hence impersonal exchange) is the ability to engage in secure contracting across time and space. That entails low transaction costs per exchange. The creation of impersonal capital markets is the single most important piece of evidence that such a necessary condition has been fulfilled." Explain and evaluate this claim by North and Weingast

# Discussion

> Carlos and Neal describe the Netherlands as a 'bank-oriented system' and Britain as a 'market-oriented system': what do they mean by this? What evidence do they point to?

--

<br> 

> Carlos and Neal recount British and Dutch finance as displaying "...a symbiosis that proved highly beneficial for both financial systems." Is it misleading to speak of a financial revolution in *England*? Is financial history inimical to history narrated in national terms? Is the interpenetration of English and Dutch markets problematic for the story told by North and Weingast?

# Discussion

>"The creation of what I call ‘the fiscal-military state’ was the most important transformation in English government between the domestic reforms of the Tudors and the major administrative changes in the first half of the nineteenth century." Is 'fiscal-military state' a useful analytical construct? 

--

<br>

> "Whatever the situation when it came to the administration of law and order, in the fiscal-military sphere the state gained a hold as never before. This grip did not, however, become the stranglehold of autocracy, which raises, of course, the question of why Britain was able to enjoy the fruits of military prowess without the misfortunes of a *dirigiste* or despotic regime." How do we reconcile Brewer's narrative of the rise of centralized state power with North and Weingast's account of checks on political authority?

## Was there an industrial revolution?

>"English society before 1832 did not experience an industrial revolution let alone an Industrial Revolution... [Its] causes have been so difficult to agree on because there was no 'Industrial Revolution', historians have been chasing a shadow" (Clark, 1986 in Mokyr, "Editor's introduction")

## Rehabilitating the industrial revolution: Mokyr's Example

+ Imagine the British economy as composed of two sectors
    1. Traditional
        + Large
        + Grows slowly
    2. Modern
        + Small
        + Grows quickly

<br>

> "A moment of reflection and a few simple computations indicate that for a country that undergoes structural change while it grows, very sudden accelerations in the growth rate of the kind that Rostow envisaged are simply impossible. Thus the finding that the aggregate effects of the Industrial Revolution are not overwhelming before 1820 is not surprising" (Mokyr, "Editor's introduction", 12).

# Questions

> "National income accounting, by itself, is not adequate to the task of presenting national economic activity" (Berg, p. 18). What are Berg's critiques of the Crafts-Harley view?

--

<br>

> "In fact, we still know too little to be able to write convincingly the type of book Berg has attempted. Perhaps her effort will, as she hopes, spur others on" (Hoppit, p. 223). What changes would Berg and Hoppit like to see in the historiography of the industrial revolution?

## Critiques of Allen

### Jane Humphries

+ Family structure as depicted is unrealistic
    - Need more than 3x a man's subsistence wage to support wife/children
    - Therefore wage averaged over family is not high
    - Implies probably women/children working $\rightarrow$ low wage labor

--

### Judy Stephenson

+ Re-examines key wage series Allen relies on: builder's wages in London

> "...the bills that have been interpreted in the past as reports of wages received by labourers and craftsmen did not, in fact, state the pay of workers, but the rates charged by major building contractors to clients for types of service. ...Once contractors’ margins are taken into account, the actual wage in London construction was significantly below the levels reported in the series that have been used by Allen and others."

## Critiques of Mokyr

### O'Brien

+ Mokyr inexplicably dismissive of the litany of other causal factors (geography, agriculture, institutions, etc)

+ Does not really examine influence of Enlightenment ideas elsewhere

> "I conclude that an enlightened economy... are labels awaiting research and development to mature into operational concepts."

]

--
<br>
> Does Mokyr's approach convince us that the industrial revolution would not have occurred without the Industrial Enlightenment?

<br>
> Does Humphries depiction of regular hunger and immiseration matter for Allen's argument? Is her criticism convincing?

--

## The early case for trade

+ Per Inikori, early writers on the IR (1880-1945) largely favor trade as an explanation
    + Toynbee (1880), Mantoux (1906), Gilboy (1932), Barnes (1937), etc.
    + External **demand** is key
    + Other mechanisms
        - Growth of market orientation (Toynbee)
        - Influx of specie (Cunningham) leading to capital accumulation
        - New *types* of demand
        - Trade as an engine for financial and political development

<br>

> "There can be little doubt that in the historiographical epoch from 1880 to 1945, the development of industrial production in England, ...was explained largely as a function of expanding overseas commerce." (Inikori, p. 101)

# Part II

## Criticisms of Trade as a Cause of the IR

+ Trade is a fraction of an industry which is a fraction of total income
    - A fraction $\times$ a fraction is usually small
    - If external demand disappears resources will be re-allocated
    
--

+ Quick example from Harley
    - What matters is the *terms of trade* -- how much Britain could purchase with its exports vs how much it would cost to produce domestically
    - Hypothetical: 
        + Trade makes grain 10% cheaper
        + Trade is 19% of national income
        + In a world without trade Britain is $10\% \times 19\% = 1.9\%$ poorer

--

> "Self-sufficiency in 1860, then, would have cost Britain only (50 per cent)∗(0.125) or about 6 per cent of national income. ... no trivial sum,to be sure, but measured against the whole rise in output per worker of roughly 80 per cent from 1855 to 1913, only one thirteenth of the story." (Harley, p.194-5).

---

## Criticisms of Trade as a Cause of the IR

--

#### Manufacturing growth as a cause of trade expansion

+ Manufactures are exported
+ Foreign markets buy British manufactures with money earned selling primary commodities to British manufacturers

--

#### General British prosperity as a cause of trade expansion

+ Deane and Cole argue:
    - Agric. Rev. $\rightarrow$ Imports
    - Foreign income from selling to Britain $\rightarrow$ Increase in British exports

**General problem that correlation $\neq$ causation**

## Rehabilitating trade: Inikori

+ Argues for a *regional* approach
  - Trade can be a big component of a small region (e.g. Lancashire)
  - Argues that regions can be treated as nearly separate economic units (I do not find this claim persuasive)
      + Domestic demand associated with agricultural revolution is in the *South*
      + Manufacturing growth is in the *North* driven by external demand
      + Britain engages in Import Substituting Industrialization (ISI)

## Rehabilitating trade: Findlay & O'Rourke

.pull-left[

+ Britain faced continuously deteriorating terms-of-trade
    - Thus supply was outstripping demand
    - Therefore unlikely that external *demand* was key

## But...

.center[

### William Clarence-Smith on Inikori

> "...a Scottish jury might well return a verdict of "not proven," if only because of the insignificance attributed to autonomous technical factors as prime movers in the Industrial Revolution. Much recent research stresses that the seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution, unique in the world, was a precondition for the technological break-throughs of the Industrial Revolution, even if the connections were often quite indirect."
]

<br>

+ Does trade explain technological change or the success of technological change?
+ Is it a necessary factor? A necessary and sufficient factor? Merely an accelerant?

---

class: center, middle, inverse

## More questions

> "Taken together with the unsuccessful processes in renaissance Italy and seventeenth-century Holland, what comes out is that sustained expansion of manufactured exports or lack of it could ultimately make the difference between completion and non-completion of the industrialization process." (Inikori)
+ Do you agree with Inikori that without trade the IR would have petered out?

--

<br>

> "Although we still lack a universally accepted theory of technological progress, it seems clear that any sensible model would yield the result that if Britain had been closed to trade, the Industrial Revolution could not have been sustained."
+ Why do Findlay & O'Rourke believe this?

### Tariffs on imported grain

1. **French Wars**: the price of grain is high
2. **1815**: wheat imports prohibited if price < 82s. 6d. per quarter
3. **1828**: sliding scale of duties, e.g. 
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 27
4. **1842**: lower sliding scale
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 14
5. **1846**: 'repeal', actual mostly flat duty
    + if price > 53, duty = 4 
    + duty + 1 as price falls up to a duty of 10
6. **1849**: duty is 1 shilling

+ A symbolic victory because of **who** voted for repeal.

        + 1903 Chamberlain Tariff debate, EU accession, Brexit
        
> "Britain’s bold move to free trade in 1846... violated the core protectionist ideology of the Conservative party while simultaneously undercutting the economic interests of the ruling landed aristocracy." <br> -Schonhardt-Bailey, p. 1
]

---

## Why?: Two broad categories of explanation

.pull-left[

#### Ideas

+ The benefits of free trade per the political economy of Smith, Ricardo, etc.

> "Writers upon political economy have already said, that the ultimate tendency of wages is to accomodate itself to the price of food. I must say that I do not believe it" <br> -Peel cited in Irwin, 1989, p. 55.

]

.pull-right[

#### Interests

> "Economists exert a minor and scarcely detectable influence on the societies in which they live... If Cobden had spoken only Yiddish, and with a stammer, and Peel had been a narrow, stupid man, England would have moved toward free trade in grain as its agricultural classes declined and its manufacturing and commercial classes grew" <br> -Stigler in Irwin, 1989, p. 41.

]

---

### What explains repeal? Schonhardt-Bailey

> "The findings of this book tell a simple but compelling story: **economic interests accounted for the momentum behind repeal**, a momentum that overshadowed almost all else. ...these same interests, left unsatisfied, could have snowballed into revolution — as Peel and others feared... Interests account for most of the dynamics of repeal, **but they do not on their own explain why reform rather than revolution emerged**... To understand that last (quite important) fraction of the whole, we require an understanding of how **the engine of interests was shaped by the forces of ideas and institutions**."<br> -SB, p. 2

> ‘‘this [French Revolution of 1848] comes of trying to govern the country through a narrow representation in Parliament, without regarding the wishes of those outside. It is what this party behind me wanted me to do in the matter of the Corn Laws, and I would not do it’’ <br> -Peel in SB, p. 39.

---

### The effect of repeal

.pull-left[

#### If Britain is a 'small' economy

+ 'Small' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is not** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Ricardo's analysis holds:
    - A fall in the price of grain pushes labor out of agriculture
    - Lowers the effective cost of labor
    - Increases manufacturing employment and profits

]

.pull-right[

#### If Britain is a 'large' economy

+ 'Large' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Torrens (1844) analysis holds:
    - Agricultural profits would decline
    - Real wages would rise
    - But manufacturing profits would **decline** as terms-of-trade deteriorate

]

********

> "The big difference between the "small" country and the "large" country view of Britain... is that in the former case, British capitalists paid most of the subsidy to British landlords under the Corn Laws, while in the latter case foreigners paid most of the subsidy." <br> -O'Rourke & Williamson, p. 86.

---

### The immediate effect on prices

> "the Laws appear to have made little difference to British grain prices; the ability of contemporaries to understand their own affairs is discredited, and the whole Corn Law controversy is made to seem pointless and 'much ado about nothing'"<br> -Fairly in O'Rourke and Williamson, p. 81.

+ But this does not interrogate the counter-factual
    - What would prices have been in the absence of repeal?
    - Crimean War, American Civil War
+ Williamson (1990) finds correlation of Prussian-GB grain prices
+ O'Rourke (1994) simulates counterfactual

.center[
![:scale 50%](counterfactual_prices.png)
]

---

## The Impact of Repeal

+ The big effects of repeal seem to emerge after the 1870s
+ Repeal appears to shift the composition of agricultural output
    - Farms move increasingly into non-tradables
    - 1870 grains = 25% of farm output
    - 1904 grains = 13% of farm output
+ More extreme shift in Ireland

> "The Emerald Isle was a lot greener in the second half of the nineteenth century" <br> OW, p. 89

<br> 

> "this event [repeal] alone was sufficient to give great impulse to the conversion of Irish arable land into pasture, to the concentration of farms, and to the eviction of small-scale cultivators... The Irishman, banished by the sheep and the ox, reappears on the other side of the ocean as a Fenian" <br> -Marx in OW, p. 90

## Solar's ruminations

> "...this article also speculates on the effects of relief on economic development. Some simple economic reasoning is used to draw out the implications of the essential features of the English system. One line of argument looks at poor relief as a system of insurance and focuses on the behaviour of beneficiaries. The other examines the way in which relief was financed and how this affected the behaviour of the property owners who paid for the system." —Solar, p. 3

.pull-left[
#### Poor Law different from continent in that

1. More uniform and comprehensive
2. Financed out of local property tax (less regressive)
3. Relatively generous

> "Poor relief, the quintessential function of local government in England, is ripe for inclusion in this new political economy of English development in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries." —Solar, p. 1
]

.pull-right[
#### Effects

+ Larger than those who are recipients (insurance)
+ On recipients
  - Fertility decisions (+/-)
  - waged labor (promotes enclosure)
  - Possibly **boosted** labor mobility
+ On payers

  - motivated landowners to limit local fertility

## Plausible globalizations

> "There have been few times in history when the world has been so closely interconnected — not only economically, but also in culture and tradition." <br> - Beatrice Manz cited in Cooper, *Colonialism in Question*, p. 100.

+ Andre Gunder Frank (before 1500)
+ Janet Abu-Lughod (before 1350)
+ Frank and Gills: "the existence of the same world system in which we live stretches back at least 5,000 years"

.pull.center[**Clearly definitions matter!**]

---

## Plausible globalizations

#### Is connection enough?

> "The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind. ... By uniting, in some measure, the most distant parts of the world, by enabling them to relieve one another's wants, to increase one another's enjoyments, and to encourage one another's industry, their general tendency would seem to be beneficial." <br> 
-Adam Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, Book 4, ch. 7, part 3.

--

#### Or does scale matter?

> "What remains ... in doubt is the contemporary impact or significance of these new configurations of long-distance trade ... it is far less clear what meaning the new connections had for those who lived in the sixteenth or even the seventeenth century" <br> 
-Tracy, *The Rise of Merchant Empires*, quoted in O'Rourke and Williamson, "When did globalization begin?"

---

## Economic Globalization as price convergence?

> "Thus, *the only irrefutable evidence that globalisation is taking place is a decline in the international dispersion of commodity prices or what might be called commodity price convergence* [Emphasis in original]." <br>
-O'Rourke and Williamson, "When did globalization begin?", p. 26.

--

### Why?

+ A measure of globalization that captures the domestic impact of global forces
+ Changes in trade volumes could just be shifts in supply or demand
+ When trade forces changes in domestic prices it can 'influence things that really matter' like income distribution, living standards, quality of life, etc.

---

## Economic globalization as price convergence?

> "We see no evidence documenting significant pre-nineteenth century global price convergence for the (competing) commodities that really mattered to the economic lives of the vast majority. Nor do we see any evidence of significant commodity price convergence even for those (non-competing) commodities that mattered little to the vast majority. The implications for world history are, we think, revisionist and profound."
<br>
-O'Rourke and Williamson, "When did globalization begin?", p. 28

#### Key questions

+ Why does this occur in 19th century?
+ What drives commodity market integration at scale?
+ What are the forces that produce commodity price convergence?
+ What are the consequences of this kind of globalization?

.pull-left[
## What were the corn laws?

### Tariffs on imported grain

1. **French Wars**: the price of grain is high
2. **1815**: wheat imports prohibited if price < 82s. 6d. per quarter
3. **1828**: sliding scale of duties, e.g. 
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 27
4. **1842**: lower sliding scale
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 14
5. **1846**: 'repeal', actual mostly flat duty
    + if price > 53, duty = 4 
    + duty + 1 as price falls up to a duty of 10
6. **1849**: duty is 1 shilling

]

.pull-right[

#### Interests

> "Economists exert a minor and scarcely detectable influence on the societies in which they live... If Cobden had spoken only Yiddish, and with a stammer, and Peel had been a narrow, stupid man, England would have moved toward free trade in grain as its agricultural classes declined and its manufacturing and commercial classes grew" <br> -Stigler in Irwin, 1989, p. 41.

### What explains repeal? Schonhardt-Bailey

> "The findings of this book tell a simple but compelling story: **economic interests accounted for the momentum behind repeal**, a momentum that overshadowed almost all else. ...these same interests, left unsatisfied, could have snowballed into revolution — as Peel and others feared... Interests account for most of the dynamics of repeal, **but they do not on their own explain why reform rather than revolution emerged**...

---

### The effect of repeal

.pull-left[

#### If Britain is a 'small' economy

+ 'Small' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is not** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Ricardo's analysis holds:
    - A fall in the price of grain pushes labor out of agriculture
    - Lowers the effective cost of labor
    - Increases manufacturing employment and profits

]

.pull-right[

#### If Britain is a 'large' economy

+ 'Large' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Torrens (1844) analysis holds:
    - Agricultural profits would decline
    - Real wages would rise
    - But manufacturing profits would **decline** as terms-of-trade deteriorate

]

********

> "The big difference between the "small" country and the "large" country view of Britain... is that in the former case, British capitalists paid most of the subsidy to British landlords under the Corn Laws, while in the latter case foreigners paid most of the subsidy." <br> -O'Rourke & Williamson, p. 86.

---

### The immediate effect on prices

> "the Laws appear to have made little difference to British grain prices; the ability of contemporaries to understand their own affairs is discredited, and the whole Corn Law controversy is made to seem pointless and 'much ado about nothing'"<br> -Fairly in O'Rourke and Williamson, p. 81.

.pull-left[
+ But this does not interrogate the counter-factual
    - What would prices have been in the absence of repeal?

+ O'Rourke (1994) simulates counterfactual

## Heckscher-Ohlin: Determinants of Trade

> "Australia has a small population and an abundant supply of land, much of it not very fertile. Land is consequently cheap and wages high, in relation to most other countries. It would therefore seem profitable to produce goods requiring large areas of less fertile land but relatively little labour. Such is the case, for example, in wool production. . . . Similarly, regions well endowed with technically trained labor and capital will specialize in industrial production. . . . Exports from one region to the other will on the whole consist of goods that are intensive in those factors with which this region is abundantly endowed and the prices of which are therefore low. . . . In short, commodities that embody large quantities of particularly scarce factors are imported, and commodities intensive in relatively abundant factors are exported. . . . **Australia exchanges wool and wheat for industrial products since the former embody much land and little labour while the opposite is true of industrial products. Australian land is thus exchanged for European labor.**"<br> -Ohlin, 1924 

---

## Heckscher-Ohlin: Determinants of Factor Prices

> "If, for example, Australia produced its own industrial products rather than importing them from Europe and America in exchange for agricultural products, then, on the one hand, the demand for labor would be greater and wages consequently higher, and on the other the demand for land, and therefore rent, lower than at present. At the same time, in Europe the scarcity of land would be greater and that of labor less than at present if the countries of Europe were constrained to produce for themselves all their agricultural products instead of importing some of them from abroad. **Thus trade increases the price of land in Australia and lowers it in Europe, while tending to keep wages down in Australia and up in Europe. The tendency, in other words, is to approach an equalization of the prices of productive factors**."<br> -Ohlin, 1924

+ Relatively higher wages in New World drove immigrants abroad
+ Also displacement from disappearing agricultural jobs

---

## Consequences: The Collapse of Agricultural Income

+ The discovery and colonization of the 'New World' raised the amount of land per European capita 6-fold!

> "Less frequently remarked upon, but equally obvious, are the long-run implications for European income distribution. Such an increase in land endowments would inevitably spell disaster for European landowners. Over-all living standards might increase, but in the long run European rents would decline, with European labor or capital benefitting." <br> -O'Rourke, "European Grain Invasion", p. 775


### Backlash to globalization

+ Several political consequences flow from 19th century globalization
    1. Tariffs on the continent (an 'Iron & Rye' alliance) 
    2. Free trade in Britain (a labor & capital alliance)
    3. Escalating immigration restriction in the New World
    4. New world tariffs to defend manufactures

---
## Key take-aways

### Heckscher-Ohlin

- What you trade is driven by factor ratios
- Trade drives factor price convergence

### Commodity prices converged over the 19th century

- especially in primary agricultural products


### Technology as a driving force for globalization

- This is in contrast to e.g. post-WWII where the creation of GATT/WTO is predominantly a political project.

## Banking and financial crises in historical perspective

<br>

.middle[
>  **Warnings from history** <br> <br> 227.  The Commission recommends that an additional external member be appointed to the FPC, with particular responsibility for **taking a historical view of financial stability and systemic risk**, and drawing the attention of FPC colleagues, and the wider public through speeches and articles, to historical and international parallels to contemporary concerns. (Paragraph 1115) <br><br> -*Changing banking for good - Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards*, Vol. 1, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/2704.htm](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/2704.htm)

# What is a Bank?

### Leverage: Barclay's Simplified Balance Sheet, 2006

.center[
![:scale 75%](figures/barclays_balance_sheet.png)
]

+ Leverage ratio $= 996,787/ 27,390 = 36.4$

---

## Leverage, Risk and Liability: Why do banks fail?

.pull-left[
### Liability-side risks

.large[
+ Runs on deposits
    - Deposits can be withdrawn at will
    - First-come-first-served
+ Can spook creditors
+ Can spark fire-sales
    - Asset-side deterioration
]
]

.pull-right[
.large[
### Asset-side risks

+ Investments also go down!
    - Economy-wide shocks (e.g. US Civil War and 'cotton famine')
    - If Barclay's assets (in 2006) declined by > 2.7% the bank is technically insolvant (net worth is negative)!

+ Why take on so much leverage?
    - Why do companies get bigger?
+ What happens in the case of failure?
    - Limited liability, double liability, unlimited liability
+ Seperation of ownership and control (agency problems)
]

.pull-right[
### Why do depositors allow it?

.large[
+ Very hard to monitor
    - I give you a list of 100s of investments (bonds, stocks, land, water, gold, wine, art, etc.) and ask how much its worth. How accurate can you be?
    - Exact asset positions not public

1. Extended liability
    - Unlikely to 'risk shift' if entire net-worth on the line

2. Regulation/Government Supervision

## Illiquidity vs Insolvency

.large[
### Insolvency

+ Liabilities exceed assets

### Illiquidity

+ Short-run demand for cash exceeds supply
+ Assets exceed liabilities but not all held as cash

### Illiquidity $\rightarrow$ Insolvency?

+ If you need to sell in a hurry the value of your assets can decline
    - Often what begins as a 'liquidity' crisis can come to look like 'insolvency'

# Part II

background-image: url("figures/bank_of_england.jpg")
background-size: cover

## The Bank of England

+ Established 1694
+ A deal between government and the Bank
    - Gov't gets loan, bank gets special privileges
        + Joint-stock, limited liability
        + Monopoly as chartered bank
        + Issued banknotes

---

## The impact of the BoE?

> "Its [the BoE's] creation resulted from the coupling of the government's urgent need for money with the bank promoters' desire for the profits of both speculation and monopoly. In this it set a pattern for the formation of national banks (later called central banks) in other countries, but **its own contributions to industrial finance were negligible, if not negative.**"
<br> - Rondo Cameron, 1967

+ Monopoly deal
    - Up until 1825 other banks limited to 6 partners
    - No small denomination notes
    - Tax on notes
    
> "However useful finance is to growth in other contexts, our study reveals that England's Financial Revolution in public borrowing enabled concurrent government activities to retard economic growth during the Industrial Revolution." 
<br> - Temin and Voth, 2013.

---

## The path to central banking: ending commercial monopoly

### The Banking System in 1815

+ Bank of England (London only)
+ Goldsmith bankers (London only, 6 partners max)
+ Small country banks (also 6 partners)
    - Massive growth in number
        + 1780: ~100
        + 1810: ~600

### Sources of reform

1. End of Napoleonic Wars
2. Merchant pressure

## Bagehot's Rule

### 1. Lend Freely

> "In opposition to what might be at first sight supposed, **the best way for the bank or banks who have the custody of the bank reserve to deal with a drain arising from internal discredit, is to lend freely.** The first instinct of everyone is the contrary. There being a large demand on a fund which you want to preserve, the most obvious way to preserve it is to hoard it — to get in as much as you can, and to let nothing go out which you can help. But every banker knows that this is not the way to diminish discredit." (23)

### 2. On good collatoral

+ Require the borrowers to put up collateral of high quality for the loans

### 3. At a penalty rate

+ *Not* as reflected in modern doctrine
+ Two reasons:
  1. Punish borrowers for getting into trouble
  2. Incentivize the private sector to lend

## Primary source exercise

### 2 'Teams'

  + You may each access copies of two share price lists (online)
      - They are **long** and **difficult** price lists from the *Investor's Monthly Manual* 

### Object

+ Describe the evolution of British lending in the period 1873-1898

### Sources

+ You may use the 2 documents provided
+ You may [access the same documents online](https://som.yale.edu/imm-issues)
+ You may draw on additional documents (online)
    - Plus the readings (obviously)

#### How to read a share price list

![:scale 80%](figures/read_prices.png)

+ **Stock**, e.g. "Guatemala 6% Sterling": Guatemalan sovereign debt pays 6% interest in sterling on nominal value
+ **Issue price**: when they created the loan what it sold for
+ **Original issue**: nominal value of debt (what is owed)
+ **Sinking fund**: is there a special fund for repayment? 
+ **Amount of loan unredeemed**: if paid back gradually how much left?
+ **Par**: nominal value of stock i.e. how much will you get paid back per stock you own. 
+ **Prices of the month**: what has the stock been trading for? E.g. Guatemala is not being traded this month
+ **Last Business Done**: last trade price. Guatemala 6% at 42 -- very low!
+ **Dividends**: where and when you can collect the interest
+ How to compute bond yield: $dividend/price = (.06 \times 100)/42 = 6/42 = .143 = 14.3\%$

## The perception of decline


> "It must be clear to everyone that we are under the shadow of a business depression...", <br> -*Banker's Magazine*, October 1883

<br>

> "Since 1862 the tide of agricultural propsperity had ceased to flow; after 1874 it turned and rapidly ebbed" <br> -Lord Ernley, *English Farming Past and Present*, 1927

<br>

> "There was, in fact, a continuous output of discussions, speeches, books, reports, and pamphlets, which prove, at least, that people thought they were depressed ... 1873 to 1896 was a period when people said there was a great depression." <br> -Beales, "The Great Depression in Industry and Trade", 1934 

???

Might begin with the name: Great Depression

+ Now if you tell someone you spent the morning in a lecture on the Great Depression they will almost certainly think you are talking about the 1930s

widespred discussion of decline

+ 2 royal commission in 70s and 90s on agriculture
+ 2 on trade and industry
+ 1 on the monetary system
+ Widespread discussion in the Political Economy Club and House of Commons

???

The drop in prices

+ Greg Clark retail price index
+ Clearly confirms what contemporaries noted -- prolonged fall in prices in the period of the Great Depression
+ **Are price declines a depression**? 
    - Not necessarily! We call this *deflation*
        * Good for lenders bad for debtors
        * Depends **what** prices are falling

---

### What might explain the fall in prices?

> "There is an immense **diminution in the production of gold.**"<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

+ Less **supply** of gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

<br>

???

Money is confusing

+ simplest way to think about the price level is as a ratio
    - What is the ratio of money to things?
    - How many things would people offer to obtain a pound?
    - How many pounds does it take to get a thing?

--

> "...the recent course of prices... is the result in part of the diminished production **and the increased extroardinary demands upon the supply of gold.**"<br> -Giffen, *Contemporary Review*, 1885.

+ Less **demand** for gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

--

> "The prime cause affecting prices, it seems to us, is plain enough, namely, the **excessive production** in all things, the use of machinery, the fruitfullness of the earth, far outstripping the wants of man combined with his power to purchase..."<br> -*Banker's Magazine*, 1885.

+ Increased **productivity** $\rightarrow$ lower prices

---

### Why were prices falling? Supply and demand for money

.pull-left[

+ US: Crime of '73
+ **A global phenomenon**

> "There is a greater strain upon gold through the discarding of silver in very important countries..."<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

![global](global_prices.png)
#### Source Flandreau et. al. 2008
]

.pull-right[
![:scale 100%](crime_73.jpg)
]

???

Crime of 73

+ US used to have a bimetallic standard
    - Dollars could be redeamed for silver **or gold**
    - Shift to gold only
+ Contraction in money supply
+ Growing demand for gold
+ This is not purely a British phenomenon!
    - The plot from Flandreau et al shows **global** prices falling

Transition

+ The background is one of monetary explanations for the fall in prices
+ But we need to consider productivity
    - Producing more with less can make goods cheaper
    - A paradigmatic case -- and one that was important to Britain, was transport

### The Agricultural Great Depression?

> "...the existence of a great depression in agriculture was, and is, universally accepted, and farmers' sufferings have been wept over by generations of mourners."<br> -Fletcher, "The Great Depression of English Agriculture", p. 417

<br>

???

Fletcher made this point in the course of critiquing it

+ We will return to his caveats
+ But general pressure on wheat is real

--

### The Impact of Falling Agricultural Prices

> "Less frequently remarked upon, but equally obvious, are the long-run implications for European income distribution. Such an increase in land endowments would inevitably spell disaster for European landowners. Over-all living standards might increase, but in the long run European rents would decline, with European labor or capital benefitting." <br> -O'Rourke, "European Grain Invasion", p. 775

???

O'Rourke raises the broader question of structural transformation

+ This has echoes of contemporary debates about the winners and losers of globalization
+ The fall in agricultural prices **helped consumers**. It made their food cheaper and left them with more money leftover to spend.
+ But it hurt farmers, and generated agricultural employment.
    - It also hurt landowners and pushed down the rate of return to land

+ The effect of tying together Britain and the US was that the rent paid to landowners fell as the profitability of British land declined
+ Likewise, the **real wage**, the wage measured in terms of what it can buy, rose
+ This is a process of **convergence**: 
    - Britain had a large population working a relatively small amount of land
    - Compared to the US wages were low and rents were high. 
    - By trading with the Americas, British wages rose toward American wages, and British rents fell toward American rents
    - Conversely, American wages fell towards British wages, and American rents rose toward British rents
    - We call this **Factor Price Convergence**

In a conventional sense of the word depression it is difficult to describe the Great Depression as such

### Could things have been better?

#### Population growth

> "The argument that Britain's output grew more slowly because of slower growing exports, however, **assumes that aggregate demand alone determined output**, when **in fact there were constraints of supply**. Indeed, there is evidence that they were the only binding constraints. ...the labour force at the end of the period would have had to have been twice as large as the actual labour force and two-fifths larger than the entire population aged 15 and over." <br> -McCloskey, p. 448-449.

#### Savings rate

.pull-left[
+ Simple accounting exercise

$$
Q = s_K K + s_L L + T
$$
+ Total growth (Q) comes from labor growth (L) with proportion $s_L$ and capital growth (K) with proportion $s_K$ and getting better at doing things (T).
]

.pull-right[
+ Re-arranging

### 2. "...too much was invested abroad because of imperfect capital markets..."

>  "By reallocating resources, of course, any one sector of the economy could have grown faster: industry could have grown at the expense of services and exports at the expense of production for home consumption had labour and capital been allocated differently. The most popular target for hypothetical reallocation has been Britain's enormous hold- ings of capital abroad in the late nineteenth century." <br> -McCloskey, p. 451.

## The export of capital debate: a simple critique

### McCloskey

.pull-left40[
+ Overseas investment earns income
+ If you don't invest abroad need to do something else with the money
+ If you invest at home:
    - Maybe home investments yield lower returns (per Edelstein)
    - Anyway **additional** home investment should push the yield on domestic capital downward
+ Ergo investing more at home $\rightarrow$ fall in income
]

.pull-right60[
>"The most popular target for hypothetical reallocation has been Britain's enormous holdings of capital abroad... It is not clear, however, that exchanging domestic for foreign capital would have raised British national income. **The question is how bringing capital home could be expected to increase income and how large the increase would have been**."<br> -McCloskey 1970, p. 451
]
---

### Key assumptions of McCloskey

+ Investors *could* have invested at home or abroad
    - They *knew* about all the options
    - Equivalently, markets are integrated
+ Their decision to invest abroad tells us about relative foreign/domestic rates of return
    - This can be and has been empirically checked e.g. Edelstein, Chabot & Kurz, Goetzman & Ukov
    - "...in emphasizing the rationality of entrepreneurs denies the very notion of failure" (Kirby 1992)
+ Rates of return do not depend on investment decisions
    - Returns $\rightarrow$ investment **not** investment $\rightarrow$ returns

### Bottom line

+ This is an argument over a **counterfactual claim**: what would have happened in Britain if foreign investment had been diverted into domestic investment?
+ Counterfactual claims can only be answered with a **theory**!!

---

## Framing the debate

### Two broad questions

  1. Was it in the interests of investors to invest abroad?
  2. Was it in the "national interest" for investors to invest abroad?
      - The term "national interest" is poorly defined but usually taken here to mean grown in GDP/pc
      
---

### Was it rational for the British investor to invest so much abroad?

### Probably yes


> "When investors are given the opportunity to divide their money between home and foreign assets, the expected rate of return on domestic assets can exceed the expected rate of return on foreign assets and an unbiased, rational investor will still choose to invest a portion of her wealth overseas if the diversification benefits of foreign investment outweigh the loss of return." <br> -Chabot & Kurz, 2010

+ 518,224 individual stock or bond 28 day returns
+ The question is not whether investors should have picked foreign or investment, the question is the **optimal mix**
+ The authors compute returns by sector, test portfolios

> "The real benefit of international investing was the diversification benefit of holding foreign assets that had a low correlation with their domestic counterparts." <br> -Chabot & Kurz, 2010

---

## Was it *socially* optimal for so much investment to go abroad?

### Much harder question

1. Were there industries that *could* have raised long-run growth if pursued?
    - E.g. electrification and chemicals which become important in 20th century
    - Can investment raise productivity? Where does innovation come from?
2. Were there large social costs to foreign investments born by the public and not investors?
    - The costs of formal and informal empire in protecting the investments abroad
3. Is the market price the right metric? Maybe we should consider the amount *originally invested*?
    - Price of a security is what current holder can sell it for, **not** necessarily a reflection of the money the company got

---

## Were key domestic industries neglected?

>"Potentially successful frustrated borrowers leave no trace" <br> -Kindleberger, *Economic Growth in France and Britain*, p. 38

+ We can directly compare **observed** foreign and domestic investment
    - We cannot directly compare foreign investment and **hypothetical** domestic investment
    - Broader question of **sample selection bias**: we compare stock-exchange listed companies but this is not a random sample!
+ The case for more domestic investment:
    - Some key industries that appear important in hindsight are not extensively developed: e.g. motor industry, new techniques in steel, electricity
    - Assumption of diminishing marginal return to capital unproven: 
    
> "...in view of the fact that capital is the changing, the transforming, the dynamic element in the economy, and that it is neither homogeneous nor easily divisible, but usually lumpy and highly specific, it is by no means certain that adding to its quantity will necessarily lower its returns"<br> -Pollard, p. 502.

> "Increasingly after the 1890’s in the editorial columns of trade journals and in the pages of government reports, for one industry after another, blame for the British lag behind Germany and America was put on British management." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg

---

## The 'Entrepreneurial Failure' view

> "It was the heirs of Veblen and Schumpeter, ...who in the 1950’s carried on the development of the hypothesis of entrepreneurial failure. An important factor in this work was a group of economic historians ... who developed the argument in the late 1940’s and 1950’s that **the linchpin of economic history is the entrepreneur**. ...Building on [a] piece presented [at] ... the Harvard University Center in Entrepreneurial History ...Landes crystallized the long-standing argument that the contrast between German and American industrial triumphs and British defeats could best be explained by emphasis on “the importance of this human factor — the success of entrepreneurial and technological creativity on one side, the failure on the other.“" <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 92

#### Menu of indictments run:

1. Britain did not adopt best technologies
2. Britain underestimated imp. of science and industrial applied research
3. Britain over-invested in export staples like cotton/iron
4. Britain was bad at sales, especially abroad
5. Britain did not organize cartels effectively 

---

### McCloskey & Sandberg's Critique

.pull-left[

#### Core of critique:

> "...But in a competitive milieu, even a brief period of irrationality would be eroded by the expansion of better managed firms, and there is little doubt that the British economy was on the whole competitive." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg p. 104

+ 'Irrational' behavior is assumed incompatible with market competition: no money on the table

> "...the orthodox neoclassical, or 'cliometric' approach, which in emphasizing the rationality of entrepreneurs denies the very notion of failure." <br> —Kirby, p. 637.
]

.pull-left[
#### Some general pertinent critiques

+ Argument by residual

> "Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth." <br> –Sherlock Holmes

<br>

> "Entrepreneurship has always been studied as a residual, because it is not a variable that can be measured directly." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 107


]

---

## McCloskey & Sandberg Critique, cont'd

#### Critique measure of entrepreneurial failure

> "...an industry’s output or an industry’s speed in adopting allegedly critical innovations ... Neither of these measures is adequate ... the measures of output because they confound influences of demand with those of supply and the measures of indicative innovations because they neglect the variability in the advantage to be gained from different innovations in different countries."<br> —McCloskey & Sandberg, p. 100

#### Discuss a gamut of industry case studies

> "One swallow, then, does not make a summer, nor do scattered cases of entrepreneurial successor failure make or break the hypothesis of general entrepreneurial failure." <br> —McCloskey & Sandberg p. 99

+ But think on balance case studies rejecting claims of irrationality

---

## Elbaum & Lazonick Institutionalist Response

.center[
![:scale 80%](figures/elbaum_lazonick_decline.png)
]

> "...the historical perspective presented below attributes the decline of the British economy to the rigid persistence of economic and social institutions from the nineteenth-century era of relatively atomistic competition. ...successful twentieth-century economic development has been based on mass production methods and corporate forms of managerial coordination. But in Britain adoption of these modern technological and organizational innovations was impeded by inherited socioeconomic constraints" <br> —Elbaum & Lazonick, p. 568

---

## Elbaum & Lazonick Institutionalist Response, Cont'd

.pull-left[
### Critique

> "...the issue of Britain's decline has largely been avoided by neoclassical economic historians who have been preoccupied with demonstrating that turn-of-the-century British managers "did the best they could" by optimizing subject to given constraints" (568)

+ Even if entrepreneurs were not irrational, this does not address the issue of decline!!
]

.pull-right[
### Argument

> "The managerial organization and technology employed by nineteenth- century British firms were comparatively simple. Characteristically, firms were run by owner-proprietors or close family associates." (569)

+ Argument is **Chandlerian**: need large-scale corporate structure

> "What British industry in general required was **the visible hand of coordinated control**, not the invisible hand of the self-regulating market."


]

---

.left-column[
## Elbaum & Lazonick's Claim

+ Is 20th century economic growth a story of states/firms subordinating markets?
]

.right-column.large[
> "There is considerable irony in the neoclassical focus on free market competition as the engine of economic dynamism. The focus derives from the fundamental assumption of neoclassical theory that firms are subordinate to markets. History suggests, however, that successful development in the twentieth century has been achieved by markets being made subordinate to firms. **The main thrust of the perspective presented here is that the British economy failed to make a successful transition to corporate capitalism in the twentieth century precisely because of the very highly developed market organization of the economy that had evolved when it was the first and foremost industrial nation.**" (582)]

---

## Elbaum & Lazonick: Critical Appraisal

#### Endorsed by Kirby as a productive agenda

> "The institutional focus, moreover, is entirely credible in the light of the intellectual stalemate which has developed in British economic history between the upholders of entrepreneurial failure and neoclassical rationality. Elbaum and Lazonick may be **accused of naivete in their assumption of the universal validity of corporate capitalism as the route to successful economic growth** in the twentieth century, but much of value remains in their analysis. There can be little doubt that in the British context the state has had a legitimate role to play in securing institutional reforms beneficial to economic progress. Only the most extreme proponent of the free market could contend, for example, that the complex structural problems of the late nineteenth-century British economy, the starting point for Elbaum and Lazonick's analysis, could have been resolved by market forces unaided" (654)

#### Some critique

+ Scholars such as Leslie Hannah suggest idea that 'small family firms' were characteristic of Europe is generally untrue
  - London and Paris stock exchanges larger and more important than New York
  - Bigger hubs for the separation of ownership and control

# Part II

### Case: The Lancashire Cotton Industry vs the New England Cotton Industry (Leunig 2003)

#### Why Lancashire?

+ Use the older technology (mule for spinning and power loom) 
  - Could be 'entrepreneurial failure' to adopt best tech?
+ Very small businesses with almost no vertical integration
  - Could be failure to adopt modern management and scale economies

> "It was the industry that grew by adding more and more firms, with little or no growth in firm size." (90)

#### Why might US be more productive?

+ Rothbarth-Habakkuk thesis

> "At its simplest, this states that in land-rich America, labour was drawn to agriculture, so that industry became characterized by high capital intensity and by correspondingly high labour productivity. In contrast, land-poor Britain had abundant industrial labour, so industry was characterized by low capital intensity and low labour productivity." (92)

---

## Not so simple to compare

> "In theory, labour productivity is easy to calculate: total output is simply divided by total employment. In reality, the process is not as straightforward because countries often produce different products, with different labour and capital requirements." (97)

+ Cotton output often measured by **weight**
  - This is bad because finer thread means more length per unit weight
+ Course thread vs fine thread are basically different products
  - E.g. used for bags vs clothes
+ Different technologies (mule vs ring) can take different quality inputs
  - Rings need higher quality (more expensive) input or fibers break
  - Mules possibly more labor but cheaper input

.pull-left[
### Leunig's approach

+ $2 \times 2 \times product$ design
+ For each thread count
]

.pull-right[

+ Compare NE to Lanc
  - For rings
  - For mules
]

---

## Results: labor productivity by technology and location

.pull-left40[
+ Lanc. spinners on mules best
+ NE on rings close for low thread count

<br>

.Large.center[**Seems pretty rational for Lancashire to use the mule!**]
]
.pull-right60.center[
![:scale 100%](figures/leunig_fig_2.png)]

---

## Results: but which location was more productive?

.pull-left40[
+ The question is given the available machines and people, where should you send a job to produce 100 lbs of 40 thread count yarn

<br>

+ **Still mostly Lancashire**
+ NE is possibly better at very low thread count output
]
.pull-right60.center[
![:scale 95%](figures/leunig_fig_3.png)]

---

## Interpretation

> .Large["I argue ...the most plausible proximate cause of Lancashire's success was external economies of scale, and that this reflects a deeper underlying advantage: vigorous competition." (108)]

+ Some vindication for McCloskey & Sandberg!
+ External economies of scale:
  - Economies of scale that are not internal to the company (obvious definition)
  - E.g. having all the skilled weavers available in Lancashire
  - Learning right away about new techniques
+ Argues that Lancashire may have been "more Chandlerian"
  - Because focused on fewer products, firms had more spindles, produced longer runs
  - More like mass production
  - Half a loaf for Elbaum & Lazonick?

---

## Some provocative reflections from Leunig

> "The idea that competition increases the pressure to be efficient may help to explain why Britain was so much more succesful in the first industrial revolution than in the second. Both of Britain's early productivity successes — textiles and agriculture — were characterized by low minimum efficient scale and high levels of competitive pressure." (110)

+ Contrast that with quintessential second IR technology: the car
  - US is big and can support multiple car firms that compete *and* have massive scale
  
> "...the size of the British domestic market was too small for Britain to have a car firm that was simultaneously large enough to gain available economies of scale, and to face sustained competitive pressure from at least one other firm." (110)

+ Concludes that you need competitive pressure **and** a market big enough to support competition at efficient scale

## Today's Plan

### 1. Framing the debate

### 2. Offer's critiques

### 3. Cain and broader counter-factuals

---

# The question

.center.Large[
> "Whether this complex institutional edifice of supranational power ... brought tangible gains to anything like a majority of British people" <br> —O'Brien, p. 163.
]

### Caveats

+ *Not* a discussion of whether empire $\rightarrow$ industrialization
  - O'Brien doesn't think so but as we saw (e.g. Inikori, Findlay & O'Rourke) people disagree
+ The debate is about the 

> "material costs and benefits for British society as a whole, imputable to political decisions to retain and extend the empire from the onset of free trade through to the First World War, 1846 to 1914" <br> —O'Brien, p. 164.

---

# Some intellectual history

+ Tradition since Smith of arguing that Empire is burden on taxpayers and "increased threats of war and the probability of political corruption at home" (O'Brien, p. 164).

>  "We do not any longer ask - we certainly do not receive - from our colonies any commercial advantages which are not equally open to the whole world, which we should not equally command though the political connection were severed tomorrow" <br> —Cairncross, 1873

### Radical critique of empire

> "... if I invest either in the public funds or in some private industrial venture in a foreign country for the benefit of my private purse, getting specially favorable terms to cover risks arising from the political insecurity of the country or the deficiencies of its Government, I am entitled to call upon my Government to use its political and military force to secure those very risks which I have already discounted in the terms of my investment. Can anything be more palpably unfair?" <br> —Hobson, 1902, p. 358.

---

# The growth of 'Imperial accountancy'

> "Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Cobden, Marx, J. A. Hobson — every generation has had a shot at this question. In the last decade this debate has taken a new turn, which might be called 'imperial accountancy'." <br> —Offer, p. 215.

+ Referring in particular to the work by 
  * **Davis & Huttenback**  
  * **Edelstein**

---

### Davis and Huttenback, *Mammon and the Pursuit of Empire*

.pull-left40[
![:scale 80%](figures/mammon_frontis.jpg)
]

.pull-right60[
+ The strong case for the economic irrationality of empire
    - Compute costs and revenues
    - Revenues go to narrow elite
    - Costs fall on the public
        + costs of defence, administration, infrastructure, opportunity costs
    - 'Winners' are specific elites and settler colony emigres
    - 'Losers' are the British taxpayer and (obviously) the colonized
]

---

### Edelstein, *Overseas Investment in the Age of High Imperialism*

.pull-left40[
![:scale 80%](figures/edelstein_frontis.jpg)
]

.pull-right60[
+ Moderately positive case for *economic benefits* of empire
    - takes a large sample of home and foreign investments
    - computes returns on 'home' vs. 'overseas' and finds positive returns abroad
    - This is familiar to us from export of capital week
    
]

---

# D&H vs. Edelstein: why do they differ?

+ D&H believe there is a 'market problem'
  - Financial markets bid assets values up and down
    + e.g. Gamestop mkt cap on 25/01 was 5b, on 27/01 it was 20b, on 04/02 it was 3.5b: total investment in Gamestop never changed! 
+ Want to compute returns on *initial investment*
  - This needs to be built with *accounting data*
  - Create a sample of 482 firms
+ D&H are using **different data** and a *different approach* to measuring rate of return

---

.pull-left[
## Offer's critique

### Critique along 2 dimensions

1. Data and measurement
  - Thinks 'market problem' is unreal
  - Thinks accounting data is poor
    
2. Costs of defence
  - Thinks costs of defence mismeasured
]

.pull-right[

> "But even if the accounting estimates of historical capital were sound, they do not necessarily form an appropriate basis for estimating economic performance. In economics, past investments are sunk costs, water under the bridge. The constant review of expectations and prospects is the essence of economic life. Investments are sold in financial markets precisely in order to facilitate this constant review, and to convert lumpy chunks of physical capital into tradeable financial assets. That is why marketable securities were issued in the first place, so it is wrong to value such enterprises by historical cost methods, even if they are updated mechanically. **The market is a more objective and public mechanism for updating values. The Edelstein methodology of relying on market valuations is thus theoretically superior.**" <br> —Offer, p. 219
]

---

## Offer on Data problems

1. Some problems of selection
  - Excludes government bonds
  - Choice of time-periods
2. Some problems of computation
  - Returns are *unweighted* meaning return to 100 mil. firm weighted the same as 1 mil. firm.
3. The market problem
  - Does not think it is real: market prices incorporate capital gains and losses

.pull-left60[
> "D. & H.'s rates of return consist of two elements: reported profits, and asset valuations. Both elements can be questioned." <br> —Offer, p. 218

+ Profits:
  - Easily manipulated 
+ Asset valuations:
  - Ad hoc adjustments for depreciation, inflation, goodwill
]
---

## Is defence like insurance? Offer's critique

+ Avner Offer offers several critiques:
    1. Defence costs per head are not sensible, consider as share of income
        + UK 2.95 % of GNP, Germany 2.86, France 4.52 (!)
    2. Defence costs in the absence of empire are not zero
        + What is the counterfactual? Argues the global trading system must be defended and benefits Britain
    3. Cannot directly compare defence costs as defence *requirements* are different
        + "If military expenditure is a form of insurance, then the higher the risk, the higher the premium required." -Offer, p. 226
    4. Should not understate how much Brits liked having the empire
        + Paid for it because they wanted it
    5. The empire was a strategic resource that paid-off in WWI
    
> "From the defence point of view, investment in empire looks very different if one stops in 1919 instead of 1912, as D. & H. chose to do."<br> -Offer, p. 235

## Edelstein on how to measure the costs


.pull-right60[
> "If the state of political and economic relations between Britain and Germany (or France or the US) provides an example of ‘non-imperialist’ economic and political relations, then the gains to Britain from ruling India (for example) can be measured as the amount by which Britain benefited from its economic relationship with India minus the benefits Britain would have gained if Britain had not ruled India but merely traded with India as she did with Germany, France or the US." <br> —Edelstein, p. 211
]


### The "marginal non-imperialist standard"

- Economic development left unchanged but at point of measurement granted independence

### The "strong non-imperialist standard"

- Assumes that countries were never involved with Britain and this affects their involvement in world economy

---

## Edelstein's estimates

![ed](figures/Edelstein_tab.png)
---

## Edelstein's estimates: does this make any sense?

+ Is it a meaningful counter-factual?
+ Social scientists often want to consider changes *ceteris paribus* ('all other things equal') — is this possible here?

### Where are the politics?

+ The geopolitics of balance of power?
+ The political economy of development?

> "...it remains difficult to envisage that the political circumstances — the non-existence of the raj — could be so drastically different without the economic circumstances — railways, ports, investments, commerce — being affected at all. ...There was little doubt that the cost of maintaining British army garrisons in India, Egypt and Natal was considerable; but were the imperialists completely wrong in arguing that, if those garrisons were withdrawn, there would be other costs to pay?"<br> —Paul Kennedy, p. 187.

+ Broader disconnect "between economic history literatures on 19th century globalization (who ignore geopolitics) and political science literatures on international relations (which ignore economics)" (Hauner et. al. 2017)?

---

## Imagining broader counterfactual histories: Cain

> "...a true perspective on its role can only be obtained by looking **beyond the confines of the cost-benefit analysis** usually adopted by economists and economic historians. Most of them recognise this to some extent." 

<br>

> "...rather than simply looking at the effects of possessing or relinquishing empire on the economic system per se, it would be more helpful to set up **a broader counterfactual enquiry**..."

<br>

> "...set it against some ***plausible* alternatives**, that is those which were actively canvassed in Britain at the time." <br> -Cain, p. 366

---

.pull-left[

### Cobden/Hobson Model

+ Possible shift in income distribution
+ More domestic investment
+ But still strong commitment to free-trade -- doubts they would have avoided imperial entanglement
    - Takes the example of Gladstone and Egypt
+ Various counterfactuals for early 20th century conflict
    - Britain less willing to shoulder defence costs, smaller anglosphere to draw on
    - War less likely?
]

.pull-right[

### "Constructive imperialism"

+ Tariff policy likely to support British infant industry/possibly cartels
+ Unlikely (per Cain) to boost growth
+ Likely to heighten conflict with Germany
+ Probably larger British military build-up, potentially WWI comes sooner (Germany claimed in 1909 that empire tariffs would be cause for war)
+ Would US support be forthcoming?

]

*****

> "Neither the radical nor the constructive imperialist alternatives would necessarily have produced a more vibrant economy, a more cohesive society or one more capable of defending itself against its enemies than the actual one presided over by gentlemanly capitalists before the 1950s."<br> -Cain, p. 372

## Political economy of poor law provision

+ Key legislative changes
  - Union Chargeability Act (1865) & Metropolitan Poor Act (1867)
  - **Shifts tax burden from poor to middle-class parishes**

****************

.pull-left[
+ The prior system:
  - Parishes nested in Poor Law unions
      + Each parish relieves its *own* poor
      + Parishes pay into Union proportional to their average expenditure on paupers, e.g. places where poor people live pay more
  - Only 'settled' persons eligible:
      + Mostly means you need to be born there
      + If you apply for relief while unsettled can be removed from parish
      + Used to dissuade applications
          - Particularly effective in cities with large migrant labor pools

# Did CAO save money?

+ Not really
  - It is more expensive to administer relief 'indoors'
  - This is not wholly offset by putting people off
  - Total real expenditures on relief **increase** between 1871 and 1881 by 7.3%

<br>

1. *1906 Education (Provision of Meals) Act* school meals
2. *Old Age Pension Act (1908)* in operation 1909
  - 5*s.* to people over 70 with income below £21
  - Pensioners **much** larger than expected $\rightarrow$ implies a **lot** of old people poor but avoiding the poor house
3. *Trade Boards Act (1909)* sets minimum wages in specific industries associated with sweat-shops
4. *Labour Exchanges Bill (1909)* which tries to match unemployed to employers
5. *Part II National Insurance Bill (1911)* unemployment insurance
    - Mandatory within a small set of industries
    - Covers about 20% of male labour force
    - Premiums paid by employees, employers and state
6. *Part I National Insurance Bill (1911)* health insurance
    - Faces more opposition
    - Compulsory and means-tested (less than £160 p.a.)

> "In October 1906, Lloyd George, then President of the Board of Trade, stated in a speech at Cardiff that if the Liberal Parliament would do something “to remove the national degradation of slums and widespread poverty and destitution” and provide “an honourable sustenance for deserving old age, . . . then the Independent Labour party will call in vain upon the working men of Britain to desert Liberalism that is so gallantly fighting to rid the land of the wrongs that have oppressed those who labour in it.”" —Boyer, p. 207

# Conclusion

> What explains the rise of social assistance legislation at the start of the 20th century?

<br>

> Boyer tells a tidy national history of social protection evolving within Britain, but why is the periodization of social protection similar globally? Do we believe the Huberman & Meissner story?

<br>

> Should the persistence of intense poverty, particularly poverty among the employed, cause us to revise the way we think about claims that the 19th c. economy was 'efficient' or operating 'as best it could'?

# Today's Plan

### 1. Economics and the Origins and Conduct of the War

### 2. The British Economy during the War

---

# Did WWI have an economic origin?

### Some theorists suggesting that it might...

#### Mercantilism

+ Ideas of economic nationalism
+ Mackinder/Mahan "affected by current notions of Social Darwinism that regarded nations and especially races as engaged in a constant struggle"

#### Imperialism

+ Smith/Marx/Hobson/Lenin/Luxembourg theories that tie imperialism to global conflict

> "The theme of the competition of capitalists for raw materials overseas as leading to war ...The competition of empires led to war." <br> —Offer, p. 10.

![tooze fertik](figures/tooze_fertik_header.png)

> "The aim of this essay is to question this common sense view of World War I as disrupting the world economy and putting an end to an era of globalization. ...We offer a narrative sketch of how one might write **a history in which the war figured not as an exogenous shock**, but as a moment of convulsive and violent realignment endogenous to that history. ...what is at stake are **the destabilizing consequences of convergence**, the basic prediction of any neoclassical vision of globalization. ...Being converged upon by Imperial Russia was every bit as unsettling to the powers of Western Europe before 1914, as the rise of China is to the United States today."<br>
-Tooze & Fertik

### A cause of WWI?

> "...capital flows and technology transfer helped Russia converge on the established powers. This disrupted pre-existing geopolitical equilibria and led Germany in particular to devise military strategies to counter the threat. ...the spread of the Industrial Revolution to Germany had earlier undermined the geopolitical equilibrium in Europe.." (O'Rourke 2019, 373).

---

# Did WWI have an economic origin?

### Some theorists suggesting it *made no economic sense*

> "The more the ultimate political and social consequences of the modern war are calmly contemplated, the more clearly will it be evident that if war is possible it is only possible ... at the price of suicide." <br> —I.S. Bloch, 1899

+ War would be so catastrophic, and so damaging to international economic system there was no 'economic' rationale to explain it.
+ Normal Angell's *The Great Illusion* (1910):
  - international web of credit/trade would be destroyed by war

**************
  
> "What is an *economic* interpretation of the First World War? ...two possible approaches. **One** is to regard the war as a problem of management, to consider the endowment[s] ...and how it affected the preperations for, the conduct and the outcome of the war. **Another** is to seek for patterns of rationality in the planning conudct and conclusion of the war. But rationality is a slippery concept." <br> —Offer, p. 15

---

## Economics and Planning for War

### Offer's thesis

> "...Britain's late-Victorian policy of free trade led to the Edwardian naval arms race and became a source of insecurity and instability. British naval hegemony, the condition of peace, was no longer tenable in a world of so many workshops. ...The real assets of British security were the bonds and resources of the English-speaking world overseas: economic, social, political, sentimental, forming a complex but effective system of practical kinship. This formidable system failed to deter, because it was not sufficiently visible to Germany, whose view of the world was circumscribed and limited to Europe."<br> —Offer, p. 6

+ Britain depends on food imports
+ So does Germany to a lesser degree
+ Causes strategic planning in both places to focus on shipping/blockades

> "...for Britain to face the Atlantic and not the Channel: to rely on overseas assets, to align with the Dominions and the United States, and to avoid a military commitment to Europe"

+ Offer suggests pushes towards naval build-up.

---

# The British Economy during WWI

> "...World War I was a watershed for the international economy, and the central role of Britain in the pre-1914 world economy was lost" <br> —Broadberry & Howlett

+ Major changes in 
  1. Government involvement in the economy
  2. Patterns of international trade
  3. Patterns of international finance
  4. Functioning of international monetary system
  5. Strength of labour representation
  6. Role of women
  7. Political participation
  8. Etc.
+ Some of these changes we will survey in coming weeks, some today

## Short-term impacts: the London Stock Exchange

#### LSE is shut-down on 31 July 1914

> "...Austria’s belligerent ultimatum to Serbia on Thursday 23 July — that transformed risk perceptions of the possibility of a major European war. It ‘came like a bombshell’, stated Bankers’ Magazine under the headline ‘The Great Crisis’. As fear supplanted greed there was a universal dash for cash, preferably gold. All sellers and no buyers meant that markets quickly ceased to function." <br> —Roberts, p. 5

.pull-left[
#### Why did the LSE close?

+ International webs of credit flow to LSE
+ European banks refuse to renew repo agreements
+ Continental exchanges suspend payments to LSE
  - Shut-down to avoid massive payments crash and bankruptcies!
+ **Example of fragility of interrupted interdependence**

## Taxes
  
> "The excess profits duty was **probably the most significant wartime fiscal innovation.** It was **the first tax to be levied on companies as opposed to their shareholders**. ...it taxed profits in excess of a stipulated peacetime standard. The rate was initially 50 per cent, but was increased to 60 per cent in April 1916 and then to 80 per cent in May 1917. There is no doubt that it was subject to much evasion and fraud (Stamp 1932: 216), but even so it was spectacularly successful as a revenue generator. By 1918/19 it was generating £285 million for the exchequer, almost a third of total revenue, making it the single most important tax wielded by the state."

## Today's Plan: The British economy in the interwar

.pull-left[

### Outline

1. How did the economy fair?
  - In terms of growth
  - In terms of our expectations
  - In comparison to elsewhere
2. The problems of unemployment
  - How bad was it?
  - Why was unemployment high?
3. The problems of monetary policy
  - Was money overvalued?
  - Why return to Gold?
  - Why was Britain so quick to abandon Gold?
]

.pull-right[

### Themes

+ Did Britain do worse than elsewhere in this period?
+ Were problems, like unemployment, actual policy failures?
  - Or conversely, were they merely reflection of longer-term slide in international competitiveness of GB?

## Warfare, Capital Destruction & Growth

.pull-left[

+ Should see growth after war b/c
  - Can build more productive things
  - Can replace destroyed capital stock
+ Therefore...
  - The harder you fall between 1913-1920,
  - The faster you should grow between 1920-1927
  
### Britain seems to underperform

+ This is especially true considering that Britain's capital intensity increases more rapidly than in other European countries

## Key problems for Britain at end of war

+ Loss of external markets:
  - During war, exports disrupted but demand remains in e.g. LA and Southeast Asia
  - Countries like Japan/USA fill export whole,
    + Hard to displace post-war
+ During war, Britain requisitioned foreign assets, sold ~10%
  - We recall income from investments abroad was *big* for GB
  - Implies ~10% fall in income frome abroad
  - This demands an *improvement* in exports to earn foreign exchange abroad, at a time when hard

## The 1920 Recession

+ Arguably over-determined
+ Demand-side view
  - Firms use wartime profits to invest, buy rivals
  - End of price-controls, inflation
  - But... from 1918-1920 Gov't cuts spending by 75%
  - Raises interest rates
  - **demand falls** while firms have excess capacity
+ Supply-side view
  - Unions strong post-war
  - Negotiates hourly reductions keeping wages constant (13% fall in working week)
  - Labor productivity constant
  - **supply-shock**

.left-column[
+ Britain's unemployment problem tends to be worse than other industrialized countries in the 1920s
    - Situation changes after 1931 when Britain abandons the Gold Standard
]
---

## Theories of the Unemployment Problem, I

### A. Government interventions in labor market (unimployment insurance)
  - Some scholars think this explains a lot of it
  - Most think it doesn't 

### B. Poor specialization in industries
  - Britain was specialised in industries (coal, iron, steel) that saw slow global growth
  - Related to longer tradition of worry about Britain's failure to excel in more dynamic sectors
    + Chemicals, electricity, new textiles (rayon), etc.
      
---

## Theories of the Unemployment Problem, II

### C. Unions 
  - In period of falling prices blocked nominal wage cuts
  - Obtained hour reductions at equivalent wages after war -- supply-side shock contributes to recession in 1920

### D. Monetary mis-alignment
  - Aim for Gold Standard at pre-War parity promotes high interest rates and tight fiscal policy
    - On gold standard, pound is over-valued relative to prices
    - Demands major nominal labor market adjustment that labor institutions not able to implement
    
> Theories C & D share view that nominal wages had downward rigidities

+ Stated plainly: 
  - people don't like the number written on each paycheck to get smaller even if it's value stays the same

---

## The Gold Standard and Unemployment

+ Britain returns to the Gold Standard in 1925 at **pre-War parity**
  - **Pre-War parity** means that sterling is redeamable for the same amount of gold as before the war
  - Since the dollar remained on gold throughout the war, this is equivalent to fixing Sterling to the pre-War $/£ exchange rate
+ **Gold Standard** here means really two things:
  1. You can convert your money into Gold at the specified price
  2. You do not face restrictions on importing/exporting that gold
  
### Difficulties of returning to Gold

+ What might be the problem of returning to Gold Standard?
  - Your goods as priced in $ get more expensive
  - To make your goods cheaper you need your labor costs to $\downarrow$
    + If they don't labor is too expensive and you get persistent unemployment

## Was gold the problem? 

### Maybe...

+ Hard to know what the 'correct' exchange rate should be
+ Keynes famously over-estimated by how much £ was overvalued
  - Keynes says ~15%
  - Subsequent estimates say 5-10%
  - Estimates very imprecise
+ Made some exports uncompetitive
  - But some argue also accelerated adjustment towards newer industries within Britain (theory B)
  - Also, if you are an industry who buys their *inputs* from abroad exchange rate makes inputs cheap

## Interwar Depression, Economic Thought and the Rise of the Corporate Economy

> "...the situation faced by British industrial firms after 1919 was profoundly different from that which had been envisaged in the closing stages of the war. Intead of the anticipated postwar prosperity there was, after a brief inflationary boom, a fierce slump, and in 1921 the unemployment rate rose above 10 per cent, never to fall below that figure again before the Second World War. **Economic depression was, then, a central fact of the interwar experience...** The effect of the depression in increasing political consciousness and stimulating the growth of the Labour Party, and its impact on the collapse of the classical paradigms of economic theory in the Keynesian revolution, have often been analysed by historians. **Less well covered, but no less important, is its impact at the level of popular business philosophy**, as more businessmen began to question the desirability of the configuration of firms and markets which they had inherited from the prewar era. **The rationalization movement** — which gained the attention of bankers, politicians and trade unionists, as well as of prominent industrialists between the wars — was an important aspect of the build up of **dissatisfaction with the market mechanism** and of the movement towards greater reliance on large firms for economic organization." <br> —Hannah, *Rise of the Corporate Economy*, p. 31-32.

The business classes were, of course, very much aware of **the need to provide a political and economic alternative to socialism**. It was their position that was endangered by depression and it behoved them to revalidate it by showing that those parts of the market system which were causing trouble could be excised by the reorganization of private capitalism." <br> —Hannah, p. 36

## Taking the long view

>  "Economic history is distinguished from economics by a predisposition to focus upon the long run. When looking at the inter-war... the timespan (1921-37) is short and punctuated by a uniquely severe depression (1929-32). Thus in arguments about the efficacy of government policies, inspired by Keynesian and anti-Keynesian conceptions of the period, historians are inclined to bring Britain's structural problems to the fore. The origins of these problems can be traced back to the 1870s and they became serious during the last great international boom of the Liberal era, 1899-1914, when the productivity of industry failed to grow at all. Britain entered the First World with an economy specialized upon a narrow range of staple industries, under intensifying threat from foreign competition."<br> —O'Brien, 128

+ Is the interwar subject to special problems apart from the recession?
+ Or is this just the continuation of a longer-term trajectory of decline?
