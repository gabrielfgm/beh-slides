# Wages, Living Standard and Precarity

.pull-left[
&gt; "However steady a man may be, however good a worker, he is never exempt from the fear of losing his job from ill-health or from other causes which are out of his control. . . . To the insufficiency of a low wage is added the horror that it is never secure." &lt;br&gt; —Reeves in Boyer, p. 1

]

.pull-right[
#### The industrial economy introduces new sources of risk

&gt; "the peasant is insecure, but he curses the weather, not social institutions." &lt;br&gt; —Tawney in Boyer, p. 3
]

**************

&gt; "By focusing on trends in full-time earnings, historians often miss what happened to those in households where the prime-age male breadwinner was unemployed or too sick to work, households headed by female workers due to the death or absence of an adult male, and households where the breadwinner, whether male or female, was too old to work or at least to work full-time."&lt;br&gt; —Boyer, p. 4.

---

## Economic Insecurity

.pull-left60[
#### Varies over life-cycle

![:scale 70%](figures/rowntree_poverty_lifecycle.png)
+ The share of population that **ever** experiences poverty much larger than share in poverty at any given moment
]


.pull-right40[

&gt; "The extent of working-class insecurity in Victorian Britain was determined by the interaction of three factors: **the probability of large negative income shocks**; the ability of households to buffer income shocks with **savings or insurance benefits** from friendly societies or trade unions, or assistance from kin; and **the existence and generosity of government social policies** (or charitable institutions) that provided benefits to partially offset income loss." &lt;br&gt; —Boyer, p. 5
]

---

## Economic Insecurity in British Economic History

.pull-left40[
&gt; The main causes of negative income shocks for working-class households were **unemployment**, **wage and hours cuts**, and prolonged **periods of illness** of the main breadwinner. To these should be added **old age**, when individuals were no longer able to work, or at least to work full-time. &lt;br&gt; —Boyer, p. 11.

# The state of poor relief

+ Recall the 'reform' of the Poor Law in 1834
  - Big push to have relief provided 'indoors' meaning within institutions
  - The logic of institutionalization was to dissuade people from seeking relief
  
### Challenges of the 1840s and 1860s

&gt; "the system used to finance the Poor Law was not able to handle sharp increases in demand for relief."

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "while it was possible to raise large amounts of charitable assistance quickly, that aid, when administered in an indiscriminate manner, often did more harm than good."

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "the “principles of 1834” clearly were not being enforced in northern industrial cities or working-class districts of London"

---

# The Campaign Against Outrelief


.pull-left[
+ Non-legislative initiative to push for more poor law provision **indoors**
+ Coupled with broader mid-Victorian 'ethic of respectability and self-help'

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; “simple industry and thrift will go far towards making any person of ordinary working faculty comparatively independent in his means. Even a working man may be so, provided he will carefully husband his resources.” &lt;br&gt; —Smiles, in Boyer, p. 78.

## Political economy of poor law provision

+ Key legislative changes
  - Union Chargeability Act (1865) &amp; Metropolitan Poor Act (1867)
  - **Shifts tax burden from poor to middle-class parishes**

****************

.pull-left[
+ The prior system:
  - Parishes nested in Poor Law unions
      + Each parish relieves its *own* poor
      + Parishes pay into Union proportional to their average expenditure on paupers, e.g. places where poor people live pay more
  - Only 'settled' persons eligible:
      + Mostly means you need to be born there
      + If you apply for relief while unsettled can be removed from parish
      + Used to dissuade applications
          - Particularly effective in cities with large migrant labor pools
]

.pull-right[
&gt; "Poor Law unions’ boards of guardians typically were dominated by members from the wealthier parishes, who responded to the increase in their taxes by looking for ways to reduce relief costs." —Boyer, p. 84

.center[**Union Chargeability Act makes tax contributions based on property values and allows 'settlement' within 1 year**]

# Did CAO save money?

+ Not really
  - It is more expensive to administer relief 'indoors'
  - This is not wholly offset by putting people off
  - Total real expenditures on relief **increase** between 1871 and 1881 by 7.3%

&lt;br&gt;
  
**************

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "In sum, while the crusade led to a sharp reduction in numbers on relief, as the COS and LGB predicted, their assertion that the workhouse test would reduce local poor rates was not correct, at least not in the short run." &lt;br&gt; —Boyer, p. 89.

## The condition of england question revisited

&gt; "The decade and a half from the turn of the twentieth century to the First World War saw an outpouring of work on poverty, economic insecurity, and living standards of the poor. ...With few exceptions, they all reached similar conclusions. **Despite growth in the average earnings of manual workers since 1850, economic insecurity and poverty remained widespread at the beginning of the new century.** Many within the working class apparently had benefitted little from the rising tide of late Victorian economic growth."

### Liberal govt and reform

.pull-left60[
+ New Liberal government pushes through multiple reform acts

1. *1906 Education (Provision of Meals) Act* school meals
2. *Old Age Pension Act (1908)* in operation 1909
  - 5*s.* to people over 70 with income below £21
  - Pensioners **much** larger than expected `\(\rightarrow\)` implies a **lot** of old people poor but avoiding the poor house
3. *Trade Boards Act (1909)* sets minimum wages in specific industries associated with sweat-shops
4. *Labour Exchanges Bill (1909)* which tries to match unemployed to employers
5. *Part II National Insurance Bill (1911)* unemployment insurance
    - Mandatory within a small set of industries
    - Covers about 20% of male labour force
    - Premiums paid by employees, employers and state
6. *Part I National Insurance Bill (1911)* health insurance
    - Faces more opposition
    - Compulsory and means-tested (less than £160 p.a.)
]

.pull-right40[
&gt; "The Liberal Welfare Reforms, considered together, represent a major shift in British social welfare policy. They provided a minimum level of assistance outside of the Poor Law to the sick, the unemployed, and the aged, and in doing so reduced the economic insecurity associated with industrial capitalism." &lt;br&gt; —Boyer, p. 204

# The political economy of reform

.pull-left[
+ The role of voice?
    - Extension of the franchise
+ Political competition?
    - The rise of labor
]

.pull-right[
&gt; “unless we can prove . . . that there is no necessity for a separate party to press forward the legitimate claims of Labour, you will find that . . . the Liberal Party will be practically wiped out and that, in its place, you will get a more extreme and revolutionary party.” &lt;br&gt; —Lloyd George

]

&gt; "In October 1906, Lloyd George, then President of the Board of Trade, stated in a speech at Cardiff that if the Liberal Parliament would do something “to remove the national degradation of slums and widespread poverty and destitution” and provide “an honourable sustenance for deserving old age, . . . then the Independent Labour party will call in vain upon the working men of Britain to desert Liberalism that is so gallantly fighting to rid the land of the wrongs that have oppressed those who labour in it.”" —Boyer, p. 207

## Reform in international context

+ Britain is, if anything, a laggard in this kind of social legislation
+ Britain is also under-performing its GDP/pc rankings
  - Welfare is 'high' relative to europe in GDP/pc terms but middling in terms of biological welfare/schooling 

.pull-left[
#### Copying?

+ Daniel Rogers has argued for international diffusion of policy ideas within the atlantic world:
  - Liberals are "eager policy borrowers, scavengers across the boundaries of national cultures"
  - But conversely the policy details of liberal reforms don't look *that much* like e.g. German model
  
#### Conditionality and Trade?

+ Huberman &amp; Meissner
]

.pull-right[

.center[![:scale 60%](figures/huberman-meissner-diffusion.png)]

+ Suggest that inter-linking trade agreements within Europe drove **stronger** social protections
+ Argue this helps to explain 'new world'/'old world' split 
  - Relevant to Britain?

# Conclusion

&gt; What explains the rise of social assistance legislation at the start of the 20th century?

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Boyer tells a tidy national history of social protection evolving within Britain, but why is the periodization of social protection similar globally? Do we believe the Huberman &amp; Meissner story?

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Should the persistence of intense poverty, particularly poverty among the employed, cause us to revise the way we think about claims that the 19th c. economy was 'efficient' or operating 'as best it could'?
