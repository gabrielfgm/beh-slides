### 3. The Liberal Reforms

> "However steady a man may be, however good a worker, he is never exempt from the fear of losing his job from ill-health or from other causes which are out of his control. . . . To the insufficiency of a low wage is added the horror that it is never secure." <br> —Reeves in Boyer, p. 1

> "The extent of working-class insecurity in Victorian Britain was determined by the interaction of three factors: **the probability of large negative income shocks**; the ability of households to buffer income shocks with **savings or insurance benefits** from friendly societies or trade unions, or assistance from kin; and **the existence and generosity of government social policies** (or charitable institutions) that provided benefits to partially offset income loss." <br> —Boyer, p. 5

# The state of poor relief

+ Recall the 'reform' of the Poor Law in 1834
  - Big push to have relief provided 'indoors' meaning within institutions
  - The logic of institutionalization was to dissuade people from seeking relief
  
### Challenges of the 1840s and 1860s

> "the system used to finance the Poor Law was not able to handle sharp increases in demand for relief."

<br>

> "while it was possible to raise large amounts of charitable assistance quickly, that aid, when administered in an indiscriminate manner, often did more harm than good."

> "the “principles of 1834” clearly were not being enforced in northern industrial cities or working-class districts of London"

## Political economy of poor law provision

  - **Shifts tax burden from poor to middle-class parishes**

****************

.pull-left[
+ The prior system:
  - Parishes nested in Poor Law unions
      + Each parish relieves its *own* poor
      + Parishes pay into Union proportional to their average expenditure on paupers, e.g. places where poor people live pay more
  - Only 'settled' persons eligible:
      + Mostly means you need to be born there
      + If you apply for relief while unsettled can be removed from parish
      + Used to dissuade applications
          - Particularly effective in cities with large migrant labor pools

> "Poor Law unions’ boards of guardians typically were dominated by members from the wealthier parishes, who responded to the increase in their taxes by looking for ways to reduce relief costs." —Boyer, p. 84

# Did CAO save money?

+ Not really
  - It is more expensive to administer relief 'indoors'
  - This is not wholly offset by putting people off
  - Total real expenditures on relief **increase** between 1871 and 1881 by 7.3%

1. *1906 Education (Provision of Meals) Act* school meals
2. *Old Age Pension Act (1908)* in operation 1909
  - 5*s.* to people over 70 with income below £21
  - Pensioners **much** larger than expected $\rightarrow$ implies a **lot** of old people poor but avoiding the poor house
3. *Trade Boards Act (1909)* sets minimum wages in specific industries associated with sweat-shops
4. *Labour Exchanges Bill (1909)* which tries to match unemployed to employers
5. *Part II National Insurance Bill (1911)* unemployment insurance
    - Mandatory within a small set of industries
    - Covers about 20% of male labour force
    - Premiums paid by employees, employers and state
6. *Part I National Insurance Bill (1911)* health insurance
    - Faces more opposition
    - Compulsory and means-tested (less than £160 p.a.)
]

.pull-right40[
> "The Liberal Welfare Reforms, considered together, represent a major shift in British social welfare policy.

> "In October 1906, Lloyd George, then President of the Board of Trade, stated in a speech at Cardiff that if the Liberal Parliament would do something “to remove the national degradation of slums and widespread poverty and destitution” and provide “an honourable sustenance for deserving old age, . . . then the Independent Labour party will call in vain upon the working men of Britain to desert Liberalism that is so gallantly fighting to rid the land of the wrongs that have oppressed those who labour in it.”" —Boyer, p. 207

## Reform in international context

# Conclusion

> What explains the rise of social assistance legislation at the start of the 20th century?

<br>

> Boyer tells a tidy national history of social protection evolving within Britain, but why is the periodization of social protection similar globally? Do we believe the Huberman & Meissner story?

<br>

> Should the persistence of intense poverty, particularly poverty among the employed, cause us to revise the way we think about claims that the 19th c. economy was 'efficient' or operating 'as best it could'?
