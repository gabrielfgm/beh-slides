## Today's Plan

### 1. Framing the debate

### 2. Offer's critiques

### 3. Cain and broader counter-factuals

---

# The question

.center.Large[
&gt; "Whether this complex institutional edifice of supranational power ... brought tangible gains to anything like a majority of British people" &lt;br&gt; —O'Brien, p. 163.
]

### Caveats

+ *Not* a discussion of whether empire `\(\rightarrow\)` industrialization
  - O'Brien doesn't think so but as we saw (e.g. Inikori, Findlay &amp; O'Rourke) people disagree
+ The debate is about the 

&gt; "material costs and benefits for British society as a whole, imputable to political decisions to retain and extend the empire from the onset of free trade through to the First World War, 1846 to 1914" &lt;br&gt; —O'Brien, p. 164.

---

# Some intellectual history

+ Tradition since Smith of arguing that Empire is burden on taxpayers and "increased threats of war and the probability of political corruption at home" (O'Brien, p. 164).

&gt;  "We do not any longer ask - we certainly do not receive - from our colonies any commercial advantages which are not equally open to the whole world, which we should not equally command though the political connection were severed tomorrow" &lt;br&gt; —Cairncross, 1873

### Radical critique of empire

&gt; "... if I invest either in the public funds or in some private industrial venture in a foreign country for the benefit of my private purse, getting specially favorable terms to cover risks arising from the political insecurity of the country or the deficiencies of its Government, I am entitled to call upon my Government to use its political and military force to secure those very risks which I have already discounted in the terms of my investment. Can anything be more palpably unfair?" &lt;br&gt; —Hobson, 1902, p. 358.

---

# The growth of 'Imperial accountancy'

&gt; "Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Cobden, Marx, J. A. Hobson — every generation has had a shot at this question. In the last decade this debate has taken a new turn, which might be called 'imperial accountancy'." &lt;br&gt; —Offer, p. 215.

+ Referring in particular to the work by 
  * **Davis &amp; Huttenback**  
  * **Edelstein**

---

### Davis and Huttenback, *Mammon and the Pursuit of Empire*

.pull-left40[
![:scale 80%](figures/mammon_frontis.jpg)
]

.pull-right60[
+ The strong case for the economic irrationality of empire
    - Compute costs and revenues
    - Revenues go to narrow elite
    - Costs fall on the public
        + costs of defence, administration, infrastructure, opportunity costs
    - 'Winners' are specific elites and settler colony emigres
    - 'Losers' are the British taxpayer and (obviously) the colonized
]

---

### Edelstein, *Overseas Investment in the Age of High Imperialism*

.pull-left40[
![:scale 80%](figures/edelstein_frontis.jpg)
]

.pull-right60[
+ Moderately positive case for *economic benefits* of empire
    - takes a large sample of home and foreign investments
    - computes returns on 'home' vs. 'overseas' and finds positive returns abroad
    - This is familiar to us from export of capital week
    
]

---

# D&amp;H vs. Edelstein: why do they differ?

+ D&amp;H believe there is a 'market problem'
  - Financial markets bid assets values up and down
    + e.g. Gamestop mkt cap on 25/01 was 5b, on 27/01 it was 20b, on 04/02 it was 3.5b: total investment in Gamestop never changed! 
+ Want to compute returns on *initial investment*
  - This needs to be built with *accounting data*
  - Create a sample of 482 firms
+ D&amp;H are using **different data** and a *different approach* to measuring rate of return

---

.pull-left[
## Offer's critique

### Critique along 2 dimensions

1. Data and measurement
  - Thinks 'market problem' is unreal
  - Thinks accounting data is poor
    
2. Costs of defence
  - Thinks costs of defence mismeasured
]

.pull-right[

&gt; "But even if the accounting estimates of historical capital were sound, they do not necessarily form an appropriate basis for estimating economic performance. In economics, past investments are sunk costs, water under the bridge. The constant review of expectations and prospects is the essence of economic life. Investments are sold in financial markets precisely in order to facilitate this constant review, and to convert lumpy chunks of physical capital into tradeable financial assets. That is why marketable securities were issued in the first place, so it is wrong to value such enterprises by historical cost methods, even if they are updated mechanically. **The market is a more objective and public mechanism for updating values. The Edelstein methodology of relying on market valuations is thus theoretically superior.**" &lt;br&gt; —Offer, p. 219
]

---

## Offer on Data problems

1. Some problems of selection
  - Excludes government bonds
  - Choice of time-periods
2. Some problems of computation
  - Returns are *unweighted* meaning return to 100 mil. firm weighted the same as 1 mil. firm.
3. The market problem
  - Does not think it is real: market prices incorporate capital gains and losses

.pull-left60[
&gt; "D. &amp; H.'s rates of return consist of two elements: reported profits, and asset valuations. Both elements can be questioned." &lt;br&gt; —Offer, p. 218

+ Profits:
  - Easily manipulated 
+ Asset valuations:
  - Ad hoc adjustments for depreciation, inflation, goodwill
]

## Is defence like insurance? Offer's critique

+ Avner Offer offers several critiques:
    1. Defence costs per head are not sensible, consider as share of income
        + UK 2.95 % of GNP, Germany 2.86, France 4.52 (!)
    2. Defence costs in the absence of empire are not zero
        + What is the counterfactual? Argues the global trading system must be defended and benefits Britain
    3. Cannot directly compare defence costs as defence *requirements* are different
        + "If military expenditure is a form of insurance, then the higher the risk, the higher the premium required." -Offer, p. 226
    4. Should not understate how much Brits liked having the empire
        + Paid for it because they wanted it
    5. The empire was a strategic resource that paid-off in WWI
    
&gt; "From the defence point of view, investment in empire looks very different if one stops in 1919 instead of 1912, as D. &amp; H. chose to do."&lt;br&gt; -Offer, p. 235

## Edelstein on how to measure the costs


.pull-right60[
&gt; "If the state of political and economic relations between Britain and Germany (or France or the US) provides an example of ‘non-imperialist’ economic and political relations, then the gains to Britain from ruling India (for example) can be measured as the amount by which Britain benefited from its economic relationship with India minus the benefits Britain would have gained if Britain had not ruled India but merely traded with India as she did with Germany, France or the US." &lt;br&gt; —Edelstein, p. 211
]


### The "marginal non-imperialist standard"

- Economic development left unchanged but at point of measurement granted independence

### The "strong non-imperialist standard"

- Assumes that countries were never involved with Britain and this affects their involvement in world economy

## Edelstein's estimates

![ed](figures/Edelstein_tab.png)
---

## Edelstein's estimates: does this make any sense?

+ Is it a meaningful counter-factual?
+ Social scientists often want to consider changes *ceteris paribus* ('all other things equal') — is this possible here?

### Where are the politics?

+ The geopolitics of balance of power?
+ The political economy of development?

&gt; "...it remains difficult to envisage that the political circumstances — the non-existence of the raj — could be so drastically different without the economic circumstances — railways, ports, investments, commerce — being affected at all. ...There was little doubt that the cost of maintaining British army garrisons in India, Egypt and Natal was considerable; but were the imperialists completely wrong in arguing that, if those garrisons were withdrawn, there would be other costs to pay?"&lt;br&gt; —Paul Kennedy, p. 187.

+ Broader disconnect "between economic history literatures on 19th century globalization (who ignore geopolitics) and political science literatures on international relations (which ignore economics)" (Hauner et. al. 2017)?

---

## Imagining broader counterfactual histories: Cain

&gt; "...a true perspective on its role can only be obtained by looking **beyond the confines of the cost-benefit analysis** usually adopted by economists and economic historians. Most of them recognise this to some extent." 

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "...rather than simply looking at the effects of possessing or relinquishing empire on the economic system per se, it would be more helpful to set up **a broader counterfactual enquiry**..."

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "...set it against some ***plausible* alternatives**, that is those which were actively canvassed in Britain at the time." &lt;br&gt; -Cain, p. 366

---

.pull-left[

### Cobden/Hobson Model

+ Possible shift in income distribution
+ More domestic investment
+ But still strong commitment to free-trade -- doubts they would have avoided imperial entanglement
    - Takes the example of Gladstone and Egypt
+ Various counterfactuals for early 20th century conflict
    - Britain less willing to shoulder defence costs, smaller anglosphere to draw on
    - War less likely?
]

.pull-right[

### "Constructive imperialism"

+ Tariff policy likely to support British infant industry/possibly cartels
+ Unlikely (per Cain) to boost growth
+ Likely to heighten conflict with Germany
+ Probably larger British military build-up, potentially WWI comes sooner (Germany claimed in 1909 that empire tariffs would be cause for war)
+ Would US support be forthcoming?

]

*****

&gt; "Neither the radical nor the constructive imperialist alternatives would necessarily have produced a more vibrant economy, a more cohesive society or one more capable of defending itself against its enemies than the actual one presided over by gentlemanly capitalists before the 1950s."&lt;br&gt; -Cain, p. 372

# Question

&gt; Is it possible to reason meaningfully about an historical counterfactual as large as the absence of British Empire?
